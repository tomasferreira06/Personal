# 3.2 Introduction to Network Analysis

#### Basic Network Traffic Investigation

**Tools Used:**

1. **Wireshark** - For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
2. **Network Miner** - For extracting and analyzing files and data from the captured network traffic.

**Setup:**

* **Environment**: A Linux workstation running Wireshark and a Windows virtual machine or guest system.
* **Network Configuration**: The virtual machine is configured with a bridged adapter to share the host's network interface.

**Capturing Network Traffic:**

1. **Network Traffic Flow**:
   * Understand that traffic can be captured at various points in a network. For example, on a home network, capturing traffic at the wireless access point might give insight into traffic between devices and the internet.
   * In this setup, capturing traffic from the wireless adapter of the host system will include traffic from both the host and the guest VM.
2. **Using Wireshark**:
   * Open Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface (e.g., `wlp3s0` for wireless).
   * Start capturing traffic.
   * On the Windows VM, open a web page (e.g., [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)) to generate network traffic.
3. **Stopping and Saving the Capture**:
   * Stop the capture in Wireshark.
   * Save the captured data in `.pcap` format.

**Analyzing Network Traffic:**

1. **Basic Analysis with Wireshark**:
   * Apply filters (e.g., `HTTP`) to view specific types of traffic.
   * Follow TCP streams to reconstruct and analyze conversations between the client and server.
   * Examine individual packets to view raw data, including HTML content and any unencrypted information.
2. **Extracting Data**:
   * Use the "Follow TCP Stream" feature to view the entire conversation.
   * Extract images and files manually or use Network Miner to automate the process.
3. **Using Network Miner**:
   * Open the saved `.pcap` file in Network Miner.
   * Network Miner will extract and display information such as IP addresses, files, and images.
   * Examine the list of images and files to reconstruct web pages or analyze the content downloaded during the network session.

**Privacy Considerations**:

* Be aware that analyzing network traffic can expose sensitive information if not encrypted.
* Use encryption (HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
* Understand the implications of traffic collection and analysis on privacy.

**Conclusion**:

* The tutorial demonstrated how to use Wireshark for capturing network traffic and Network Miner for analyzing and extracting data.
* These tools are powerful for network investigations and understanding traffic, but they also raise privacy concerns, especially regarding unencrypted data.
