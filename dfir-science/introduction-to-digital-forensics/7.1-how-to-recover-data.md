# 7.1 How to recover data

**Data Recovery**

* **Objective**:
  * Extract as much information as possible from the copied data.
* **Common Tasks**:
  * Recover deleted files.
  * Recover hidden partitions or hidden files.
  * Recover file fragments (parts of files that may have been deleted, overwritten, or hidden).

**Techniques and Tools**

* **Data Structures**:
  * Files and partitions often have identifiable structures (e.g., file headers and footers).
  * By understanding these structures, investigators can manually or automatically extract relevant data.
* **Manual Data Recovery Example**:
  * Identify the start (header) and end (footer) of a file (e.g., a JPEG image) and copy everything in between to recover the file.
* **Automated Tools**:
  * Various tools exist to automate the data recovery process by recognizing and extracting known data structures.

**Fragments and Fragmentation**

* **Data Fragments**:
  * Only parts of a file may be recoverable if other data has overwritten parts of it. These fragments can still provide valuable information.
* **Fragmentation**:
  * Data is not always stored sequentially on a hard drive, which can complicate the recovery process. Fragmented files may contain interspersed irrelevant data, making them harder to recover accurately.
* **Challenges of Fragmentation**:
  * Fragmentation can prevent straightforward recovery of files by disrupting the sequence of data. Understanding fragmentation is key to accurate data recovery.

**Practical Application**

* **Data Recovery Practice**:
  * This week includes hands-on exercises to practice data recovery, using both automated tools and manual methods to recover data from your own devices.
