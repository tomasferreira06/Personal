# 5.2 Scientific Method in Digital Investigations

#### Overview of Digital Investigations

**Objective of Investigation:**

* The primary aim is to answer a specific question, such as whether a computer was used to download illegal images.
* Investigations seek to prove or disprove reasonable explanations and ensure all possibilities are considered.

**Impartiality and Bias:**

* Investigators must remain neutral and avoid bias, despite the emotional and cultural influences they may encounter.
* Personal or media biases can affect the investigation, so it's crucial to recognize and manage these biases.

#### The Scientific Method in Investigations

**1. Asking a Question:**

* Define a specific, clear question for the investigation.
* Avoid overly broad or vague questions, as they can complicate the investigation and results.

**2. Background Research:**

* Conduct research relevant to the case, including understanding the type of crime, suspect profiles, and available data.
* Assess if you have sufficient data to answer the question.

**3. Formulating Hypotheses:**

* Develop hypotheses based on what could have happened.
* Example hypotheses might include:
  * A human used a web browser to download images.
  * A BitTorrent client was used.
  * A virus downloaded the images.

**4. Testing Hypotheses:**

* Experiment and gather data to support or refute each hypothesis.
* Identify potential traces in the system that correspond to each hypothesis.

**5. Analyzing Data:**

* Analyze the collected data and compare it to the expected traces for each hypothesis.
* Determine which hypotheses are supported by the evidence.

**6. Drawing Conclusions:**

* Conclude which hypothesis is most supported by the evidence.
* Be cautious about claiming definitive results; focus on probability and likelihood.
* Address who might have committed the act if possible, acknowledging limitations.

**7. Documentation:**

* Prepare detailed reports for courts or other stakeholders.
* Ensure the documentation is clear, objective, and within the scope of your expertise.

**Additional Points:**

* Always be aware of potential biases and strive to minimize their impact.
* Focus on the most likely hypotheses and be open to discovering new questions as the investigation progresses.
* Avoid making claims beyond your expertise, and refrain from asserting who specifically was at the keyboard unless confirmed by direct evidence.

This process helps ensure that investigations are thorough, objective, and based on evidence rather than personal assumptions or biases.
