# 3.1 Intro to Computers

#### **Computer Basics**

* **Components Overview**
  * **Desktop Computer**: Consists of a CPU (tower), monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
  * **Inputs**: Devices like keyboards and mice that send data into the computer.
  * **Outputs**: Devices such as monitors and printers that display or produce data from the computer.
  * **Power Source**: Provides electrical power to the computer components.

#### **Inputs and Outputs**

* **Input Devices**:
  * **Keyboard and Mouse**: Used to enter data and commands.
  * **Older Standards**: PS/2 ports for keyboard and mouse, and serial ports for peripherals.
  * **Modern Input**: USB ports for various devices.
* **Output Devices**:
  * **Monitor**: Displays the visual output from the computer.
  * **Printer**: Produces physical copies of documents.
* **Networking**:
  * **Network Cables**: Connect to routers for internet access, serving as both input and output for data.

#### **The Computer Case and Internal Components**

* **Computer Case**:
  * **Ventilation**: Holes for air circulation to prevent overheating.
  * **Power Source**: Converts AC power from the wall into DC power for the computer.
* **Back of the Computer**:
  * **Ports**: Includes USB, HDMI, VGA, and audio ports.
  * **Expansion Slots**: For additional cards like graphics or sound cards.

#### **Motherboard**

* **Central Role**: The motherboard is the main circuit board housing the computer's crucial components.
* **Key Components**:
  * **CPU (Processor)**: The brain of the computer, performing calculations and processing tasks.
  * **RAM (Memory)**: Temporary storage that provides quick access to data.
  * **SATA Connectors**: For connecting storage devices like hard drives and CD-ROMs.
  * **PCI/PCIe Slots**: For adding expansion cards like graphics or network cards.
  * **CMOS Battery**: Maintains system settings and time when the computer is off.

#### **Detailed Components**

* **Power Source**:
  * Supplies power to the motherboard, hard drives, and other components.
* **Drives**:
  * **CD-ROM and DVD Drives**: Optical drives for reading and writing disks.
  * **Hard Drives**: Permanent storage for data and applications.
* **Heat Management**:
  * **Heat Sink**: Attached to the CPU to dissipate heat and prevent overheating.

#### **Modern Connections**
