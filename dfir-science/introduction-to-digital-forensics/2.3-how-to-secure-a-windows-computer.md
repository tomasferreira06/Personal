# 2.3 How to secure a Windows computer

#### **Introduction to Securing a Windows System**

* **Importance of User Behavior**: Many attacks occur due to user actions, like clicking on malicious links or opening unsafe files.

#### **Steps to Secure Your Windows System**

1. **Upgrade to Windows 10**:
   * Essential if you are still using Windows 7 or XP (no longer supported).
   * Older systems are inherently insecure.
2. **Check for Updates Regularly**:
   * Access via: `Start Menu` > `Settings` > `Update & Security`.
   * Manually check for updates at least once a week, even if automatic updates are enabled.
   * Keeping your system updated protects against many vulnerabilities.
3. **Enable Windows Defender**:
   * Found under `Update & Security`.
   * If using a third-party antivirus, you can run Windows Defender as additional background protection.
   * Ensure the following are turned on:
     * **Real-time protection**
     * **Cloud-based protection**
     * **Automatic sample submission** (depending on privacy preferences)
4. **Implement a Backup Plan**:
   * Use either Windowsâ€™ built-in backup or a third-party tool like CrashPlan.
   * Automatic backups protect against data loss from incidents like crypto lockers (ransomware).
5. **Adjust Privacy Settings**:
   * Customize privacy settings according to your comfort level.
   * Consider turning off services like location and radios if not needed.
6. **Manage Installed Apps**:
   * Periodically review `Apps & Features`.
   * Remove apps that are unnecessary or unrecognized (after verifying their purpose).
7. **Enable Windows Firewall**:
   * Found under `Network & Internet` > `Windows Firewall`.
   * Ensure the firewall is on to block incoming connections.
   * Optionally, block all incoming connections for maximum security.
   * Keep notifications on for new apps being blocked.

#### **Summary of Key Actions**

* **Update OS**: Keep your Windows version up to date.
* **Check for Updates**: Regularly ensure your system and Defender are patched.
* **Enable Security Features**: Use Windows Defender and a firewall.
* **Backup Data**: Have a reliable backup plan in place.
* **Privacy Settings**: Configure privacy options to suit your needs.
* **App Management**: Regularly review and clean up installed applications.

#### **Final Thoughts**

* **User Behavior**: Safe online practices significantly reduce security risks. Avoid downloading unknown programs and visiting unsafe websites.
