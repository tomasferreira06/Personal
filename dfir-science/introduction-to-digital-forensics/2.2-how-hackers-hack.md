# 2.2 How hackers hack

## Demonstration Summary: How Hackers Exploit Browsers and Social Engineering

### Introduction

* The demonstration is focused on how hackers can exploit browsers and take control of systems.
* Emphasis on the increasing reliance on web-based applications, making browsers a primary target for hackers.
* Tools used: **Kali Linux** and **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework Project)**.

### Setting Up the Attack

* **Network Setup**:
  * Attacker’s IP: `10.1.0.237`
  * Web server’s IP: `10.1.0.232`
  * Victim’s IP (Windows 10): `10.1.0.233`
* **Ping Test**: Ensured the victim's computer can communicate with the attacker's computer.

### Exploiting the Browser

* **BeEF Hook**: Injected malicious JavaScript (`hook.js`) into a web page (`test.html`).
* **Browser Exploitation**:
  * Victim visits the malicious webpage, unknowingly triggering the BeEF hook.
  * Control panel shows the victim's browser is "hooked," providing details like browser type, version, and installed plugins.
* **Persistence**:
  * Demonstrated how to maintain control by redirecting the victim’s browser to an iframe that loads a legitimate-looking webpage while retaining control.

### Social Engineering Attacks

* **Fake Flash Update**:
  * Presented a fake Flash update prompt, leading the victim to download malware disguised as a Flash Player.
* **Google Phishing**:
  * Redirected the victim to a fake Google login page, capturing their credentials.
  * Successfully logged the victim's username and password.
* **Facebook Phishing**:
  * Displayed a fake Facebook login prompt, capturing the user's credentials.
  * Highlighted the importance of two-factor authentication to mitigate such attacks.

### Additional Exploits and Techniques

* **Detecting Virtual Machines**:
  * Showed how attackers can detect if the victim’s system is running in a virtual environment, which might indicate a security test environment.
* **Command Execution and Further Exploitation**:
  * Discussed the use of various commands to gather intelligence, exploit vulnerabilities, and maintain access to the victim's system.

### Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)

* **Generating Malicious Files**:
  * Used the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) to create a malicious PDF embedded with an executable file.
  * Demonstrated how such files can be used to compromise a system when opened by the victim.

### Conclusion

* Emphasized the ease with which hackers can exploit browsers and use social engineering techniques to steal information.
* Importance of staying vigilant, using up-to-date software, and implementing multi-factor authentication to protect against such attacks.

### Key Takeaways

* **Browsers as Targets**: Modern browsers are prime targets due to the increasing use of web-based applications.
* **Social Engineering**: One of the most effective ways hackers trick users into compromising their own security.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Crucial in defending against credential theft.
* **Security Awareness**: Users should be aware of the risks of downloading files, clicking on links, and entering credentials on unfamiliar websites.
