# 3.1 Intro to Computers II

#### Introduction to Computer Hardware

Welcome back everyone! Today, we'll be diving into the basics of computer hardware. We'll start with the CPU, move on to RAM, explore hard drives, and finish with video cards and storage solutions.

**1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

The **CPU** is like the brain of the computer. It performs calculations and processes instructions. Think of it as a very fast and sophisticated calculator. The CPU has tiny components called capacitors, and the more capacitors it has, the more powerful it can be.

**Functions:**

* **Processing Data:** Handles calculations and tasks required to display information or perform operations.
* **Interaction:** Commands other hardware components (like the graphics card) to display information on the screen.

**2. Random Access Memory (RAM)**

**RAM** can be likened to a temporary workspace or a notebook. When the CPU needs to process data, it temporarily stores it in RAM for quick access.

**Characteristics:**

* **Temporary Storage:** Holds data that the CPU is actively working on.
* **Speed:** Faster than hard drives, but data is lost when power is off.
* **Usage:** Stores running applications, active data, and input like passwords.

**3. Hard Drives**

Hard drives store data long-term. There are two main types:

* **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):**
  * **Structure:** Contains spinning metal disks and read/write heads.
  * **Function:** Data is stored magnetically on these disks.
  * **Pros/Cons:** Cost-effective for large storage but slower in speed.
* **Solid State Drives (SSDs):**
  * **Structure:** Contains flash memory chips; no moving parts.
  * **Function:** Faster data access compared to HDDs.
  * **Pros/Cons:** Expensive but more reliable for speed and durability.

**4. Video Cards**

A **video card** (or graphics card) is specialized hardware that handles video processing and rendering. It has its own processor (GPU) and memory (VRAM).

**Functions:**

* **Video Processing:** Handles complex visual tasks like rendering graphics or videos.
* **Specialization:** Efficient at video tasks but less effective for general processing.

**5. Upgrading Components**

* **Desktops:** Components like CPUs, RAM, hard drives, and video cards can be upgraded or replaced.
* **Laptops:** Components are more integrated and harder to upgrade, but RAM and storage can often be replaced.

**6. Smartphones**

Smartphones are compact computers with integrated components:

* **Inside:** Most smartphones have a single chip that combines the CPU, RAM, and storage.
* **Challenges:** Miniaturization makes these components expensive and complex to manufacture.

**Components:**

* **Battery:** Powers the phone.
* **Main Chip:** Integrates processing, memory, and storage.

#### Summary

In summary, whether it's a desktop, laptop, or smartphone, all computers have similar core components:

* **Processing Unit:** CPU or GPU for handling tasks and calculations.
* **Temporary Storage:** RAM for active data.
* **Long-Term Storage:** Hard drives or SSDs for permanent data.
