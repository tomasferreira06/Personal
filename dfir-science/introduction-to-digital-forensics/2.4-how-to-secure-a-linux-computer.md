# 2.4 How to secure a Linux computer

#### **Securing a Linux System: Introductory Tips**

* **Focus**: This guide is aimed at securing Linux desktop systems, with similar principles to securing Windows desktops.

#### **Steps to Secure Your Linux System**

1. **Keep Software Up-to-Date**:
   * **Use the Latest Supported Version**: Upgrade to the latest version of Linux.
   * **Update the Core System**: Regularly upgrade your OS (e.g., Ubuntu releases).
   * **Update Installed Packages**:
     * Use package managers like `apt` (Debian-based) or `yum` (Red Hat-based) to update installed software.
     * Commands:
       * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`
       * Red Hat/CentOS: `sudo yum update`
   * **Manual Updates**: If software is installed from the source (e.g., in `/opt`), it needs to be updated manually.
2. **Install and Use Antivirus**:
   * **Antivirus Importance**: Even though Linux is less susceptible to viruses, itâ€™s still possible to get infected or accidentally pass on viruses to others.
   * **Recommended Antivirus**: `ClamAV` with GUI frontend `ClamTK`.
     * Use `ClamTK` for scheduling scans and updating virus definitions.
     * Command-line updates with `freshclam`.
3. **Use Rootkit Hunter**:
   * **Install `rkhunter`**: Detects rootkits by scanning for traces left behind.
   * **Command to Scan**: `sudo rkhunter --check`
   * **Usage**: Run it periodically or automate it to ensure your system is free of rootkits.
4. **Enable and Configure Firewall**:
   * **Default Firewall**: Most Linux systems use `iptables`.
   * **Simplified Firewall**: Install `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) for easier rule management.
     * GUI: `Gufw` (Graphical interface for `ufw`).
   * **Basic Setup**:
     * Turn on the firewall.
     * Set incoming connections to "Deny" and outgoing to "Allow" by default.
     * Optionally, lock down outgoing connections by writing specific rules.
5. **Implement a Backup Solution**:
   * **Use Built-in Backup Tools**: Most Linux distributions come with a backup utility.
     * Backup options: Files, software selection, etc.
   * **Preferred Backup Solution**: `CrashPlan` for centralized, encrypted backups across multiple systems.

#### **Summary**

* **Keep System Updated**: Regularly upgrade the OS and installed packages.
* **Install Antivirus**: Use `ClamAV` to scan for malware.
* **Use Rootkit Hunter**: Periodically check for rootkits.
* **Configure Firewall**: Turn on and configure a firewall to block unauthorized access.
* **Backup Data**: Use a reliable backup solution to protect your files and system configuration.
