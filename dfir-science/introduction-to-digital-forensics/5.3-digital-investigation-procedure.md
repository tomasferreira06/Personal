# 5.3 Digital Investigation Procedure

## Digital Forensic Investigation Process Overview

**1. Identification**

* **Objective**: Determine if a crime or event has occurred.
* **Challenges**: Many crimes are reported by victims, and not all victims report or realize they've been victimized. Detect anomalies via systems or audits.

**2. Preservation**

* **Objective**: Protect the digital crime scene.
* **Challenges**: Data changes constantly if the device is on. Techniques include live data forensics and ensuring data relevance.
* **Key Actions**:
  * Record the deviceâ€™s state (on/off).
  * Preserve data by taking snapshots.
  * Document custody of the device.

**3. Collection**

* **Objective**: Gather both hardware and data without altering them.
* **Challenges**: Need legal authority (warrants) to seize devices.
* **Key Actions**:
  * Collect hardware and data, ensuring to document everything.
  * Consider the scope of the warrant.
  * Handle volatile data with care.
  * Reduce data to focus on relevant information.

**4. Examination**

* **Objective**: Analyze collected hardware and data.
* **Challenges**: Data must be analyzed without altering the original.
* **Key Actions**:
  * Verify data integrity using hashing.
  * Convert data into a human-readable format.
  * Use checklists and maintain chain of custody.
  * Perform pre-processing to manage data.

**5. Analysis**

* **Objective**: Interpret data in context.
* **Challenges**: Ensure accurate conclusions by understanding the context of information.
* **Key Actions**:
  * Use relational analysis (linking people, places, things).
  * Conduct functional analysis (how systems/applications work).
  * Perform temporal analysis (patterns over time).

**6. Presentation**

* **Objective**: Communicate findings clearly.
* **Challenges**: Results must be understandable and detailed.
* **Key Actions**:
  * Provide an executive summary of key results.
  * Detail all actions and findings in a comprehensive case report.
  * Ensure documentation allows replication of analysis.
  * Use visual aids (timelines, link analysis) for clarity.

**7. Decision**

* **Objective**: Decide on further investigation or case closure.
* **Challenges**: Based on findings, determine if further investigation is needed or if the case is ready for legal proceedings.
