# 2.1 Cybersecurity

### Cybercrime and Cybersecurity

* Cybercrimes occur when cybersecurity fails.
* Cybersecurity is the first line of defense against cybercrime.
* Key aspects: Planning, implementing solutions, and educating people.

### CIA Model of Cybersecurity

* **Confidentiality:**
  * Protecting the privacy of information.
  * Only authorized individuals should access the data.
  * Breaches can occur if too many people have unnecessary access.
* **Integrity:**
  * Ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness.
  * Prevents unauthorized modification of data (e.g., contracts).
* **Availability:**
  * Ensuring data is accessible to authorized users when needed.
  * Attacks on availability can disrupt services, e.g., ransomware encrypting files.

### Cybersecurity Practices

* **Hardening Systems:**
  * Limiting services accessible to the public.
  * Example: Implementing passwords for email servers.
* **Least Privilege Principle:**
  * Users should have the minimum access necessary.
  * Reduces risk if a user's account is compromised.

### Layered Security Approach

* **Individuals:**
  * Use personal firewalls and practice good email habits.
* **Organizations:**
  * Implement different security levels, separate departments, etc.
  * Layered security is effective but not foolproof.

### Importance of Education

* **Technical and Human Factors:**
  * Secure internet-facing systems with strong technical measures.
  * Educate employees to avoid social engineering attacks.
* **Internet-Accessible Devices:**
  * Devices directly online are quickly scanned and attacked.
  * Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems for protection.

### Internal Security Measures

* **Limit User Access:**
  * Users often have full control over their computers.
  * Attackers can exploit this to gain network access.
* **Common Attack Vectors:**
  * **Browser Attacks:**
    * Infected websites can exploit browser vulnerabilities.
    * Keep browsers and plugins updated.
  * **Email Attacks:**
    * Malicious attachments and links can install malware or steal information.
  * **SQL Injection:**
    * Exploits weaknesses in web forms to access databases.
  * **Brute Force Attacks:**
    * Automated programs guess passwords to gain access to systems.

### Conclusion

* **No Single Method for Security:**
  * Security requires a combination of technical methods and user awareness.
* **Basic Security Tips:**
  * Keep software and antivirus updated.
  * Avoid suspicious websites, emails, and attachments.
