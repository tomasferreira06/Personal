# 5.1 Digital Investigation Definition

#### Digital Forensic Investigation Overview

**1. Definition of Digital Investigation**

* **Digital Investigation:** A process to answer questions about digital states and events. For instance, finding out how a file is stored on your computer and its exact location.

**2. Difference Between Digital Investigation and Digital Forensic Investigation**

* **Digital Investigation:** Simply finding data on a device.
* **Digital Forensic Investigation:** Involves a rigorous process to ensure that the evidence is acceptable in court. This includes specialized procedures to ensure the evidence is reliable, reproducible, and valid.

**3. Definition of Digital Forensic Investigation**

* **Digital Forensic Investigation:** The "collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence for a court of law."

**4. Digital Evidence**

* **Definition:** Data that supports or refutes a hypothesis during an investigation.
* **Challenges:** Unlike physical evidence (e.g., a knife), digital evidence needs to be translated into a human-readable form. This translation can introduce information loss or errors.

**5. Evidence Dynamics in Digital Investigations**

* **Evidence Dynamics:** Changes to evidence due to various factors, which may or may not be intentional. Examples include:
  * **System Administrators:** May accidentally overwrite evidence while repairing systems.
  * **Offender Covering Behavior:** Malicious actions like hackers deleting traces of their activities.
  * **Victim Actions:** Users inadvertently deleting evidence.
  * **Secondary Transfer:** Data being overwritten during interactions between devices.
  * **Witness Actions:** Witnesses deleting evidence out of good intentions.
  * **Nature/Weather:** Natural elements causing damage to digital evidence.

**6. Admissibility of Digital Evidence**

* **Requirements:** Evidence must be:
  * **Relevant:** Pertains directly to the case.
  * **Reliable:** Derived using procedures that are verifiable and reproducible.
* **Judicial Discretion:** Even if evidence meets jurisdictional standards, the court has the discretion to admit or reject it.

**7. Forensically Sound Procedures**

* **Forensically Sound:** A process that preserves the original meaning of the data and allows other investigators to replicate findings. The evidence should be reliable, complete, accurate, and verifiable.

**8. Daubert Standard (U.S. and other jurisdictions)**

* **Testing:** The procedure used must be tested and proven effective.
* **Error Rate:** There should be a known error rate for the procedure.
* **Publication:** The procedure should be published and reviewed by peers.
* **Acceptance:** The procedure should be generally accepted by the forensic community.

**9. Chain of Custody**

* **Definition:** An unbroken audit trail documenting what was done to the evidence, when, and by whom. Crucial for ensuring evidence integrity and preventing tampering.
