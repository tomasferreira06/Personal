#### Breaking Passwords on Files with John the Ripper

**Objective**: Learn how to use John the Ripper (John) to crack passwords on protected files, such as PDFs and ZIP archives.

**Tools Used:**

1. **John the Ripper** - A command-line tool for brute-force password cracking.
2. **PDF-John** and **Zip-John** - Utilities for extracting password hashes from PDF and ZIP files, respectively.

**Setup and Usage:**

1. **Installing John the Ripper**:
   * **Linux**: Download the source, run `./configure`, `make`, and `make install`.
   * **Windows/macOS**: Download precompiled binaries or build from source. Commands are similar across platforms.
2. **Brute-Force Password Cracking**:
   * **Generate Passwords**: Run `john --incremental --stdout` to see John generating possible passwords. This demonstrates the brute-force process of trying different combinations.
3. **Cracking a PDF Password**:
   * **Extract Password Hash**:
     * Use `pdf2john` to extract the password hash from the PDF file.
     * Command: `pdf2john.py /path/to/secret.pdf > pdf.hash`
   * **Crack the Password**:
     * Run John on the extracted hash file: `john pdf.hash`
     * Monitor the progress and wait for John to crack the password.
     * Use `john --show pdf.hash` to display the cracked password.
4. **Cracking a ZIP File Password**:
   * **Extract Password Hash**:
     * Use `zip2john` to extract the password hash from the ZIP file.
     * Command: `zip2john /path/to/secret.zip > zip.hash`
   * **Crack the Password**:
     * Run John on the extracted hash file: `john zip.hash`
     * Monitor the progress and wait for John to crack the password.
     * Use `john --show zip.hash` to display the cracked password.
5. **Observations**:
   * **Password Complexity**: Simple passwords (e.g., "test123") are cracked quickly, while more complex or less common passwords take longer.
   * **Impact of Password Patterns**: Common patterns (e.g., "1234") are cracked faster compared to unusual patterns (e.g., "4321").
   * **Password Length**: Shorter passwords are easier to crack. John defaults to an 8-character limit, so adjust configurations for longer passwords.
6. **Configuration**:
   * For longer passwords or different character sets (e.g., Unicode), modify Johnâ€™s configuration and use additional dictionaries or libraries.

**Conclusion**:

* John the Ripper is a powerful tool for password cracking, demonstrating the importance of using complex and unique passwords.
* The time to crack a password can vary significantly based on its complexity and length.
