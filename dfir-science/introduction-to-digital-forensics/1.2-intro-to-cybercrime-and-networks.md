# 1.2 Intro to Cybercrime and Networks

**Cybercrime Overview**:

* **Definition**: Cybercrime generally refers to criminal activities conducted via the internet or other computer networks. The definition varies by jurisdiction, influenced by cultural and legal perspectives on technology.
* **Cybercrime vs. Computer Crime**: Cybercrime focuses on the connections between systems, while computer crime focuses on using the computer as a tool or victim.

**Network Connections**:

* **Communication Protocols**: Devices on the internet communicate using the TCP/IP protocol, which functions like a language between computers. Each device has a unique IP address, similar to a phone number, allowing it to connect to others.
* **Security Risks**: Devices and software can create vulnerabilities, often exploited by cybercriminals. Regular software updates are crucial for minimizing these risks.

**Types of Cybercrime**:

* **Motivation**: Most cybercrimes are financially motivated, with criminals seeking profit through various means.
* **Methods**: Cybercriminals may steal data, control devices, or use compromised systems to commit further crimes (e.g., sending spam emails or conducting denial-of-service attacks).

**Cybercrime in Korea**:

* **Prevalence**: Online fraud, particularly auction fraud and blackmail via chat platforms, is common in Korea due to the ease of instant money transfers and the widespread use of communication apps.
* **Global Aspect**: Many cybercrimes involve international components, complicating law enforcement efforts due to jurisdictional limitations.

**Law Enforcement Challenges**:

* **Jurisdiction**: Police are limited by their jurisdiction, making cross-border cybercrime investigations challenging without cooperation from other countries.
* **International Cooperation**: Successful cybercrime investigations often require collaboration between countries, which can be difficult due to varying laws and priorities.

**Conclusion**:

* Cybercrime is a complex and evolving field, with connections between systems being a core focus. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, understanding these connections and the challenges of international cooperation becomes increasingly important for effective law enforcement and personal cybersecurity.
