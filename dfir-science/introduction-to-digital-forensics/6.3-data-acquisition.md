# 6.3 Data Acquisition

### Data Acquisition and Verification in Digital Forensics

#### Prior Considerations

* **Preservation of Data:**
  * Ensure the best possible copy, aiming for minimal changes.
  * The copy should be verifiable as an exact representation of the original data.
* **Acquisition of All Data:**
  * Consider limitations that may prevent acquiring all data.
  * Identify and understand any issues that prevent complete data acquisition.
* **Verification of Acquired Data:**
  * Ensure the acquired data is correct (exact copy).
  * Ensure the process and results can be verified by a third party.

#### Key Principles

* **Don't Change Data:**
  * Collect data without modifying the original.
  * If data is altered, justify and document the modifications, ensuring evidence integrity.

#### Tools and Techniques

* **Write Blocker:**
  * **Purpose:** Prevents modification of the original data during acquisition.
  * **Functionality:** Allows data to be read but blocks any write operations to the suspect's hard drive.
  * **Types:** Physical device or software.

#### Device Acquisition

* **Types of Data Sources:**
  * Hard drives, RAM, mobile devices, drones, etc.
* **Considerations:**
  * Determine what data needs to be acquired.
  * Identify potential challenges (e.g., encryption).
* **Common Scenario:**
  * Hard drive acquisition from a powered-off computer.
  * Use a write blocker for safe data transfer.

#### Saving Data

* **Forensic Disk Image:**
  * A bit-for-bit copy of a hard drive, saved as a file.
  * **File Size:** Equal to the original disk size (without compression).
* **Cloning:**
  * Copy data directly onto another hard drive (less common than disk images).

#### Ensuring Data Integrity

* **Cryptographic Hashing:**
  * **Purpose:** Verifies that the acquired data is identical to the original.
  * **Common Algorithms:** MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
  * **Process:**
    1. **Initial Hash:** Generate a hash of the original suspect disk before acquisition.
    2. **Acquisition:** Create a forensic disk image.
    3. **Post-Acquisition Hashes:** Hash the original disk and the disk image.
    4. **Comparison:** Ensure all hashes match, confirming data integrity.

#### Summary

* **Objective:** Prove that the copy is exactly the same as the original and that the original data remains unaltered during the process.
* **Practical Application:** In-class exercises on disk imaging, data acquisition, and hashing to reinforce the concepts.
