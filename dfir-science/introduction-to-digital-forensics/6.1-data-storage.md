# 6.1 Data Storage

#### Data Storage Fundamentals

**1. Understanding Data Representation**

Data on computers is stored as binary digits, or **bits**, which are ones and zeros. These bits are organized into various structures to form meaningful data like files, images, and documents. In digital forensics, we need to interpret these bits correctly to recover and analyze information.

**2. Data Storage Layers**

*   **Physical Layer**: This is the actual hardware that stores data. Examples include hard drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). Data is represented as:

    * **HDDs**: Use magnetic charges on a spinning disk. A magnetic charge represents a `1`, and the absence of it represents a `0`.
    * **SSDs**: Use electric charges stored in flash memory cells. An electric charge represents a `1`, and no charge represents a `0`.

    To acquire data from these devices, forensic investigators create a **physical disk image**, which is an exact, bit-for-bit copy of the physical storage. This allows them to work with a replica of the data without altering the original.
*   **Logical Layer**: This involves dividing physical storage into logical sections. These sections can be:

    * **Partitions**: Sections of a physical disk that can be formatted with different file systems.
    * **Volumes**: Logical containers that store files and are part of partitions.

    Forensic investigators may create a **logical disk image**, which captures only the data currently accessible within a partition. This type of image is usually smaller and may miss some deleted or hidden files.

**3. File Systems**

File systems manage how data is stored and retrieved on a disk. They define the structure and rules for file storage. Different operating systems use different file systems, such as:

* **NTFS**: Common in Windows, supports large files and advanced features like permissions and encryption.
* **HFS+**: Used by macOS, supports metadata and journaling.
* **ext4**: Common in Linux, offers robust performance and reliability.
* **FAT32/exFAT**: Often used in USB drives due to broad compatibility, but with limitations on file sizes and features.

#### Forensic Procedures

**1. Acquisition**:

* **Physical Disk Image**: Copies all data from the physical device, including deleted files and system areas.
* **Logical Disk Image**: Captures data from specific partitions, potentially missing some deleted or hidden files.

**2. Analysis**:

* Forensic tools interpret the raw binary data into human-readable formats.
* **File System Analysis**: Involves examining how files are organized, identifying file types, and recovering deleted files.

**3. Manual Verification**:

* It's essential to understand how forensic tools convert raw data into meaningful information.
* **Hashing**: Used to verify that a copied image is identical to the original by comparing hash values (a form of digital fingerprint).

#### Challenges and Considerations

* **Partially Destroyed Data**: Forensic techniques can sometimes recover data from corrupted or partially destroyed files, though recovery may be incomplete.
* **Data Structures**: Understanding file systems and how they store and retrieve data is critical for accurate analysis and recovery.

In summary, forensic investigators need to handle data at various levels, from physical storage to logical partitions and file systems. Understanding these concepts helps ensure that the data acquired is accurate and reliable for legal proceedings.
