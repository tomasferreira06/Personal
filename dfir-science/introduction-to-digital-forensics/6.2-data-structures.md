# 6.2 Data Structures

#### Understanding Data Structures

**1. Data Location and Acquisition**

**Data Location**:

* **Physical Storage Devices**: All data resides on some form of physical storage, such as hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), or random access memory (RAM). To access and analyze this data, forensic investigators work with physical copies of these storage devices.

**Data Acquisition**:

* **Physical Disk Image**: Forensic investigators aim to acquire a **physical disk image**, which is a bit-for-bit copy of the entire storage device. This allows them to recover as much information as possible, including deleted files and hidden data. The process involves copying all data, including system areas and slack space, to ensure that no data is overlooked.

**2. Data Representation**

* **Hexadecimal View**: Data is often examined in **hexadecimal (hex) view** during investigations. Hex view allows investigators to see binary data as readable hexadecimal values, making it easier to identify patterns and structures in the data.
* **Binary Strings and Data Structures**: Data structures are rules or formats used to organize data. By understanding these structures, investigators can interpret raw binary data effectively. For example, timestamps and file headers are represented in specific binary formats, and knowing these formats helps in extracting meaningful information.

**3. Data Structures**

**Definition**:

* **Data Structures**: These are predefined formats or rules for organizing data. They provide a way to interpret raw binary data. For example, a file system might use specific structures to store file names, sizes, and timestamps.

**Importance in Forensics**:

* To accurately interpret data, investigators need to understand the data structures used by the file systems and file types they are examining. Without this understanding, raw data (ones and zeros) would be meaningless.

**Common Data Structures**:

* **File Formats**: Different file types (e.g., JPEG, DOCX) have specific data structures that dictate how data is organized within the file.
* **File Systems**: File systems (e.g., NTFS, ext4) have structures that define how data is stored on the disk, including metadata and file allocation tables.

**4. Finding and Using Data Structures**

**Sources for Data Structures**:

* **Online Searches**: Many data structures are documented online by forensic experts and software developers. Searching forums and technical resources can provide insights into common data structures.
* **Developer Documentation**: For proprietary formats, companies might provide documentation on data structures. For example, Microsoft provides documentation for file formats like DOCX, which can be useful for forensic investigations.
* **Research Articles**: Academic and industry journals often publish detailed information about data structures, especially for newer or complex file types.
* **DIY Research**: When official documentation is unavailable, investigators may need to reverse-engineer data structures by analyzing sample files and understanding their layout through experimentation.

**5. Practical Application**

**Hexadecimal Analysis**:

* Forensic tools often provide hex view of data, where investigators can manually analyze the binary data. Recognizing patterns and understanding data structures helps in identifying critical information such as file signatures, metadata, and other key elements.

**Data Extraction**:

* By applying known data structures, investigators can extract and reconstruct data. For example, extracting a timestamp from binary data involves knowing the format in which the timestamp is stored.

**Enforcement of Integrity**:

* Ensuring that the data acquired and analyzed is accurate involves using hashing techniques to verify that copies of data are identical to the original.

#### Summary

In digital forensics, interpreting data accurately requires understanding the data structures that organize the raw binary data. This involves:

* Acquiring a complete and accurate physical disk image.
* Using hexadecimal view to analyze raw data.
* Applying knowledge of data structures to extract meaningful information.
