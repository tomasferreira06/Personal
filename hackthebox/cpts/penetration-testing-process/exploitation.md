# Exploitation

During the `Exploitation` stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If we want to get a reverse shell, we need to modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to us over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the `Exploitation` stage.



### Prioritization of Possible Attacks

Once we have found one or two vulnerabilities during the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage that we can apply to our target network/system, we can prioritize those attacks. Which of those attacks we prioritize higher than the others depends on the following factors:

* Probability of Success
* Complexity
* Probability of Damage

First, we need to assess the `probability of successfully` executing a particular attack against the target. [CVSS Scoring](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) can help us here, using the [NVD calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) better to calculate the specific attacks and their probability of success.

`Complexity` represents the effort of exploiting a specific vulnerability. This is used to estimate how much time, effort, and research is required to execute the attack on the system successfully. Our experience plays an important role here because if we are to carry out an attack that we have never used before, this will logically require much more research and effort since we must understand the attack and the exploit structure in detail before applying it.

Estimating the `probability of damage` caused by the execution of an exploit plays a critical role, as we must avoid any damage to the target systems. Generally, we do not perform DoS attacks unless our client requires them. Nevertheless, attacking the running services live with exploits that can cause damage to the software or the operating system is something that we must avoid at all times.

**Prioritization Example**

| **Factor**                | **Points** | **Remote File Inclusion** | **Buffer Overflow** |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1. Probability of Success | `10`       | 10                        | 8                   |
| 2. Complexity - Easy      | `5`        | 4                         | 0                   |
| 3. Complexity - Medium    | `3`        | 0                         | 3                   |
| 4. Complexity - Hard      | `1`        | 0                         | 0                   |
| 5. Probability of Damage  | `-5`       | 0                         | -5                  |
| **Summary**               | `max. 15`  | 14                        | 6                   |

Based on the above example, we would prefer the `remote file inclusion` attack. It is easy to prepare and execute and should not cause any damage if approached carefully.
