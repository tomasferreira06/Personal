# Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus



Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable.

We can utilize Nessus to perform a vulnerability scan on a target system, after which, we can import the Nessus results in to MSF for analysis and exploitation.

Nessus automates the process of identifying vulnerabilities and also provides us with information pertinent to a vulnerability like the CVE code.

We can use the free version of Nessus (Nessus Essentials), which allows us to scan upto 16 IPs.

#### To access the Nessus GUI run:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">systemctl start nessusd.service</mark>

Access it at <mark style="color:red;">https://127.0.0.1:8834</mark>.

You can export the report in XML format, to import into Metasploit.
