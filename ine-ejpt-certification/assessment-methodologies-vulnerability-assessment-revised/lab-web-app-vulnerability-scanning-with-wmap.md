# LAB: Web App Vulnerability Scanning with WMAP

#### **Step 1:** Open the lab link to access the Kali GUI instance

#### **Step 2:** Identify the target IP address

To begin with you will need to identify the target system's IP address, this can be done by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
ifconfig
```

As shown in the following screenshot, locate the IP address associated with the **eth1** interface, the target IP address is the next IP within the subnet.

In this case the Kali Linux IP is **192.157.89.2** so the target IP will be **192.157.89.3**.

**Note:** Your target IP address will be different, so make sure to substitute the IP shown in the commands below with the one in your lab.

#### **Step 3:** Web app vulnerability scanning with WMAP

Before we can begin, we will need to startup the Metasploit Framework console (msfconsole), this can be done by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
msfconsole
```

To begin with, we will need to load the WMAP extension, this can be done by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
load wmap
```

We can now add the WMAP site by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
wmap_sites -a 192.157.89.3
```

We will also need to add the target IP address as a target site, this can be done by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
wmap_targets -t http://192.157.89.3
```

As shown in the following screenshot, you can view the available sites by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
wmap_sites -l
```

You can also view the list of defined targets, this can be done by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
wmap_targets -l
```

We can begin performing the web app vulnerability scan by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
wmap_run -t
```

As shown in the following screenshots, this will begin testing the target and will display a list of available modules that can be run against the target web server.

Now that we have been able to identify what modules can be run against the target web server, we can perform a web app vulnerability scan on the target by running the following command:

**Command:**

```
wmap_run -e
```

As shown in the following screenshot, this will run all enabled modules against the target web server and will display the results of the modules.
