# Vulnerability Analysis: EternalBlue

## MS17-010 EternalBlue Exploit

* EternalBlue (<mark style="color:red;">MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144</mark>) is the name given to a collection of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
* The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the <mark style="color:green;">Windows SMBv1</mark> protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.

#### This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows:&#x20;

* Windows Vista&#x20;
* Windows 7&#x20;
* Windows Server 2008&#x20;
* Windows 8.1&#x20;
* Windows Server 2012&#x20;
* Windows 10&#x20;
* Windows Server 2016

The EternalBlue exploit has a MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system if vulnerable to the exploit and also has an exploit module that can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.

## Practical Demo

### Manual Exploitation
