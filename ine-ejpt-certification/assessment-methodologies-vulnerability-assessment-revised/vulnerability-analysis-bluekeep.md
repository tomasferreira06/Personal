# Vulnerability Analysis: BlueKeep

## CVE-2019-0708 - BlueKeep

* BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is the name given to an RDP vulnerability in Windows that could potentially allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
* The BlueKeep exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows RDP protocol that allows attackers to gain access to a chunk of kernel memory consequently allowing them to remotely execute arbitrary code at the system level without authentication.

#### The BlueKeep vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows:&#x20;

* XP&#x20;
* Vista&#x20;
* Windows 7&#x20;
* Windows Server 2008 & R2

## Exploit

* The BlueKeep vulnerability has various illegitimate PoCâ€™s and exploit code that could be malicious in nature. It is therefore recommended to only utilize verified exploit code and modules for exploitation.
* The BlueKeep exploit has an MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system is vulnerable to the exploit and also has an exploit module that can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.
