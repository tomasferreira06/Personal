* <mark style="color:blue;">Network Scan:</mark> Use Nmap to identify open ports and services. ‚óè Vulnerability Scanning: Use Metasploit to find and exploit vulnerabilities.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Web Application Testing</mark>: Use Burp Suite to test web applications (if applicable).

2. Validating Remediation:&#x20;

* <mark style="color:blue;">Compare Results:</mark> Compare initial audit findings with penetration test results to verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Check for New Vulnerabilities:</mark> Identify and remediate any new vulnerabilities introduced during the remediation phase.

3. Reporting:&#x20;

* <mark style="color:blue;">Executive Summary</mark>: Provide an overview of the penetration test and major findings.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Methodology:</mark> Detail the tools and techniques used during the test.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Findings:</mark> Describe vulnerabilities found, including severity and potential impact.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Recommendations:</mark> Offer steps to further secure the system.
