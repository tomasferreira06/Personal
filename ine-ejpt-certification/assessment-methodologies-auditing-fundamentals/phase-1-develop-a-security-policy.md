# Phase 1 - Develop a Security Policy

## From Audit to Pentest

**Background:**&#x20;

* Company: SecureTech Solutions&#x20;

**Description:**&#x20;

* SecureTech Solutions is a fictitious cybersecurity consultancy that specializes in securing IT infrastructure for various clients.&#x20;
* In this example, we will be demonstrating the process of developing a security policy for Linux servers, performing a risk assessment using the NIST SP 800-53 framework, performing a security audit and testing the remediations.&#x20;
* This example will guide you through the entire process, from initial policy creation to auditing and penetration testing, highlighting the importance of compliance with industry standards. From Audit to Pentest

## Phase 2 - Developing a Security Policy

#### Objectives:

* Establish a baseline security policy for Linux servers that aligns with NIST SP 800-53 guidelines, ensuring that servers are configured and managed securely.&#x20;
* This policy should ensure that Linux servers are secure and protected from unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and other security threats.&#x20;
* It will be used to establish baseline security requirements for configuring, maintaining, and monitoring Linux servers within the organization, aligned with NIST SP 800-53.

**Security Policy Development Process: Requirements Gathering**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:blue;">Purpose</mark>: Define the purpose and scope of the security policy.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Access Control:</mark> Outline user account management, authentication methods, and privilege management.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Audit and Accountability:</mark> Specify logging requirements and log review procedures.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Configuration Management:</mark> Define baseline configurations, software update practices, and change management.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Identification and Authentication:</mark> Enforce strong password policies and unique user identification.
* <mark style="color:blue;">System and Information Integrity</mark>: Implement malware protection, security monitoring, and vulnerability management.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">Maintenance:</mark> Outline controlled maintenance and approved maintenance tools.
