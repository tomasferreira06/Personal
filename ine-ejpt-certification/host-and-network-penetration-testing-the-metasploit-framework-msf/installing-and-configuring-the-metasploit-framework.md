# Installing & Configuring The Metasploit Framework

MSF and its required dependencies come pre-packaged with Kali Linux which saves us from the tedious process of installing MSF manually.

## The Metasploit Framework Database

* MSFDB is an integral part of the Metasploit Framework and is used to keep track of all your assessments, host data scans etc...
* The Metasploit Framework uses PostgreSQL as the primary database server, as a result, we will also need to ensure that the  PostgreSQL database service is running and configured correctly.
* The Metasploit Framework Datbase also facilitates the importation and storage of scan results from various third party tools like Nmap and Nessus,

## Installation Steps

* Update our repositories and upgrade our Metasploit Framework to the latest version.
* Start and enable the PostgreSQL database service.
* Initialize the Metasplot Framework Datase (msfdb).
* Launch MSFconsole
