# Searching For Publicly Available Exploits

* After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
* Exploit code can easily be found online, however, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous. It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it works as intended.
* There are a handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that yoy should use when searching for exploits online:
  * <mark style="color:red;">Exploit-db</mark>
  * <mark style="color:red;">Rapid7</mark>

### Using Google Dorks to find exploits

* <mark style="color:red;">vsftpd 2.3.4 site:exploit-db.com</mark>
  * Filters by site

Getting exploits from github might be dangerous, because it might not be legitimate.
