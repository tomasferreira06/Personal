# PowerShell-Empire

* <mark style="color:red;">PowerShell-Empire</mark> is a pure PowerShell exploitation/post-exploitation framework built on cryptological-secure communications and flexible architecture.
* Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing <mark style="color:red;">powershell.exe</mark>, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging fro keyloggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network deteciton, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework.
* PowerShell Empire recently received an update and is now officially support and maintained by Kali Linux, more information regarding the update can be found here: [https://www.kali.org/blog/empire-starkiller/](https://www.kali.org/blog/empire-starkiller/)

## Starkiller

* In addition to being updated and modernized, BC Security the company responsible for maintaining the Empire has also developed a companion the Empire called Starkiller.
* Starkiller is a GUI Frontend for the Powershell Empire. It is an Electron application written in VueJS and provides users with an intuitive way of interacting with Empire.
* In order to get an understanding of how Empire works and the components that make up the framework, I would recommend going through the official documentation which can be found here: [https://www.powershellempire.com/](https://www.powershellempire.com/)
* PowerShell-Empire & Starkiller are both available as packages in the Kali Linux repositories
