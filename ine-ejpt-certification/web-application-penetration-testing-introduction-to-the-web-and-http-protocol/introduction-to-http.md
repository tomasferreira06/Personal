# Introduction To HTTP

## HTTP Protocol

* HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a stateless application layer protocol used for the transmission of resources like web application data and runs on top of TCP.&#x20;
* It was specifically designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.&#x20;
* HTTP utilizes the typical client-server architecture for communication, whereby the browser is the client, and the web server is the server.&#x20;
* Resources are uniquely identified with a URL/URI.&#x20;
* HTTP has 2 versions; HTTP 1.0 & HTTP 1.1.&#x20;
  * HTTP 1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP and has several advantages over HTTP 1.0 such as the ability to re-use the same connection and can request for multiple URIâ€™s/Resources.

* During HTTP communication, the client and the server exchange messages, typically classified as HTTP requests and responses.&#x20;
* The client sends requests to the server and gets back responses.
