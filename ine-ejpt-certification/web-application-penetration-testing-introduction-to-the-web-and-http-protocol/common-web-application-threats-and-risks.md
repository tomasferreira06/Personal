# Common Web Application Threats & Risks

* Given the increased adoption of web applications, it comes as no surprise that web apps are constantly exposed to various security threats and risks due to their widespread accessibility and the valuable data they process.&#x20;
* Understanding these common security threats is crucial for developers, security professionals, and organizations to implement effective measures and safeguard their web applications.&#x20;
* The actual impact and severity of each threat may vary depending on the specific web application and its security measures.&#x20;
* Web application security requires a proactive and comprehensive approach to mitigate these threats and protect sensitive data and user interactions effectively.

## Threat vs Risk

* <mark style="color:red;">Threat:</mark>&#x20;
  * A threat refers to any potential source of harm or adverse event that may exploit a vulnerability in a system or organization's security measures.&#x20;
  * Threats can be human-made, such as cybercriminals, hackers, or insiders with malicious intent, or they can be natural, such as floods, earthquakes, or power outages.&#x20;
  * In the context of cybersecurity, threats can include various types of attacks, like malware infections, phishing attempts, denial-of-service attacks, and data breaches.
*   <mark style="color:red;">Risk:</mark>&#x20;

    * Risk is the potential for a loss or harm resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability in a system or organization.&#x20;
    * It is a combination of the likelihood or probability of a threat occurrence and the impact or severity of the resulting adverse event.&#x20;
    * Risk is often measured in terms of the likelihood of an incident happening and the potential magnitude of its impact.&#x20;


* In summary, a threat is a potential danger or harmful event, while risk is the probability and potential impact of that event happening.&#x20;
* Threats can exist, but they may or may not pose a significant risk depending on the vulnerabilities and security measures in place to mitigate them.

* These security threats are just some of the many risks that web applications face.&#x20;
* To address these challenges, organizations should adopt a multi-layered security approach, including secure coding practices, regular security testing, user education on security best practices, and the continuous monitoring and updating of web application components and infrastructure.&#x20;
* Being proactive and staying informed about emerging threats is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of web applications in an everevolving threat landscape.&#x20;
* From the perspective of a web application penetration tester, it is important to get a firm grasp of the top/common threats faced by web applications.
