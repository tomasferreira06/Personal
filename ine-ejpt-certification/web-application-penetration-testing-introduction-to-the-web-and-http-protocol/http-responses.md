# HTTP Responses

## HTTP Response Components

### Response Headers

* Similar to request headers, response headers provide additional information about the response. Common headers include:&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Content-Type:</mark> The media type of the response content (e.g., text/html, application/json).&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Content-Length:</mark> The size of the response body in bytes.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Set-Cookie:</mark> Used to set cookies on the client-side for subsequent requests.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Cache-Control:</mark> Directives for caching behavior.

### Response Body (Optional)

* The response body contains the actual content of the response. For example, in the case of an HTML page, the response body will contain the HTML markup.

## HTTP Request Response Example

* Now that we know what an HTTP request comprises of, let us inspect HTTP responses.

* In response to the HTTP Request, the web server will respond with the requested resource, preceded by a bunch of new HTTP response headers.&#x20;
* These new response headers from the web server will be used by your web browser to interpret the content contained in the Response content/body of the response.

## HTTP Response Example

* The code snippet below is an example of a typical web server response.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">NOTE:</mark> The body of the response/page content has been omitted as it is not relevant at this point in time.&#x20;
* Let us inspect some of these HTTP response headers in greater detail.

## HTTP Response Status-Line

* The first line of an HTTP Response is the Status-Line, consisting of the protocol version (HTTP 1.1) followed by the HTTP status code (200) and its relative textual meaning (OK).

## HTTP Response Data Header

* The "Date" header in an HTTP response is used to indicate the date and time when the response was generated by the server.&#x20;
* It helps clients and intermediaries to understand the freshness of the response and to synchronize the time between the server and the client.

## HTTP Response Cache-Control Header

* The Cache headers allow the Browser and the Server to agree about caching rules. It allows web servers to instruct clients on how long they can cache the response and under what conditions they should revalidate it with the server.&#x20;
* This helps in optimizing the performance and efficiency of web applications by reducing unnecessary network requests.

## HTTP Response Content-Type Header

* The "Content-Type" header in an HTTP response is used to indicate the media type of the response content.
* It tells the client what type of data the server is sending so that the client can handle it appropriately.

## HTTP Response Content-Encoding Header

* The "Content-Encoding" header in an HTTP response is used to specify the compression encoding applied to the response content.&#x20;
* It tells the client how the server has encoded the response data, allowing the client to decode and decompress the data correctly.

## HTTP Response Server Header

* The Server header displays the Web Server banner, for example, Apache, Nginx, IIS etc.&#x20;
* Google uses a custom web server banner: gws (Google Web Server).
