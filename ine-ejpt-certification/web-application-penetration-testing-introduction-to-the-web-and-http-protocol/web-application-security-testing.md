# Web Application Security Testing

* Web application security testing is the process of evaluating and assessing the security aspects of web applications to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential security risks.&#x20;
* It involves conducting various tests and assessments to ensure that web applications are resistant to security threats and can effectively protect sensitive data and functionalities from unauthorized access or malicious activities.&#x20;
* The primary goal of web application security testing is to uncover security flaws before they are exploited by attackers.&#x20;
* By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, organizations can enhance the overall security posture of their web applications, reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, and protect their users and sensitive information.

## Web Application Security Testing Types

* Web application security testing typically involves a combination of automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques.&#x20;
* Some common types of security testing conducted on web applications include:&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Vulnerability Scanning:</mark> Using automated tools to scan the web application for known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure configurations, and outdated software versions.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Penetration Testing</mark>: Simulating real-world attacks to assess the application's defenses and identify potential security weaknesses. This involves ethical hacking to gain insights into how an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Code Review and Static Analysis:</mark> Manual examination of the application's source code to identify coding flaws, security misconfigurations, and potential security risks.
* <mark style="color:red;">Authentication and Authorization Testing:</mark> Evaluating the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms and access control features to ensure that only authorized users have appropriate access levels.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">Input Validation and Output Encoding Testing:</mark> Assessing how the application handles user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">Session Management Testing</mark>: Verifying how the application manages user sessions and related tokens to prevent session-related attacks.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">API Security Testing:</mark> Assessing the security of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) used by the web application for data exchange and integration with other systems.

## Web Application Penetration Testing

* Web application pentesting, is a subset of web application security testing that specifically involves attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities.&#x20;
* It is a simulated attack on the web application conducted by skilled security professionals known as pentesters, bug bounty hunters or ethical hackers.&#x20;
* The process involves a systematic and controlled approach to assess the application's security by attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities.

## Web App Pentesting vs Web App Security Testing

* Key differences between web app security testing and web app pentesting:&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Scope:</mark> Web application security testing covers a broader range of assessments, including static and dynamic analysis, while web application pentesting focuses on actively exploiting vulnerabilities.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Objective:</mark> The primary goal of security testing is to identify weaknesses, whereas pentesting aims to validate vulnerabilities and assess the organization's ability to detect and respond to attacks.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Methodology:</mark> Security testing includes both manual and automated techniques, while pentesting is predominantly a manual process, involving the use of various tools and techniques for exploitation.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:red;">Exploitation:</mark> Security testing does not involve exploitation of vulnerabilities, while pentesting does, albeit in a controlled and authorized manner.
