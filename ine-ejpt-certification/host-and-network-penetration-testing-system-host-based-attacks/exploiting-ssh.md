# Exploiting SSH

* SSH is a remote administration protocol that offers encryption and is the sucessor to Telnet.
* It is typically used for remote access to servers and systems.
* SSH uses TCP  port 22 by default, however, like other services, it can be configured to use any other open TCP port.

#### SSH authentication can be configured in two ways:

* Username & password authentication
* Key based authentication
* In the case of username and password authentication, we can perform a brute-force attack on the SSH server in order to identify legitimate credentials and consequently gain access to the target system.

## Practical Demo

Enumerate the target

In this case we will perform a brute force attack:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common\_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common\_passwords.txt targetIP -t 4 ssh</mark>
