# Exploiting FTP

* FTP is a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/clients.
* It is also frequently used as a means of transferring files to and from the directory of a web server.
* FTP authentication requires a username and password combination. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legitimate credentials.
* In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access to the FTP server without providing any legitimate credentials.

## Practical Demo

Enumerate target

In this case it is running <mark style="color:red;">proFTPD 1.3.5a.</mark>

We will perform a bruteforce in ftp with Hydra:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common-users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix\_passwords.txt targetIP -t 4 ftp</mark>

Now login using any found credentials.

To download files:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">get nameoffile</mark>

We can also search through searchsploit for exploits for the particular version of FTP running on the target.
