## Active Information Gathering

* Active information gathering, in the context of penetration testing, refers to the phase of the assessment where the tester actively interacts with the target system or network to collect data and identify potential vulnerabilities.
* This phase involves techniques that go beyond passive reconnasissance (where information is gathered without directly interacting with the target) and may include activities such as scanning, probing, and direct interaction with network services.
