# Network Mapping

## Network Mapping

* Network mapping in the context of penetration testing refers to the process of discovering and identifying devices, hosts, and network infrastructure elements within a target network.
* It is used to gather information about the network's layout, understand its architecture, and identify potential entry points for futher exploitation.

## Network Mapping Objectives

* Discovery of Live Hosts
* Identification of Open Ports and Services
* Network  Topology Mapping
* Operating  System Fingerprinting
* Service Version Detection
* Identifying Filtering and Security Measures

## Nmap Functionality

* Host Discovery
* Port Scanning
* Service Version Detection
* Operating System Fingerprinting
