# Persistence Via Services

## Practice Demo

Start by identifying the vulnerable service on the target system.

We identify the rejetto http file server running.

Use the metasploit module to exploit it and gain a meterpreter session on the target system.

#### MSF Module

* <mark style="color:red;">exploit/windows/local/persistence\_service</mark>: Generates (with msfvenom) and uploads an executable and makes it a persistent service.&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">YOU NEED A PRIVILEGED SESSION TO ACHIEVE THIS</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">NOTE:</mark> IT is super important to delete the files after the pen test is done.
