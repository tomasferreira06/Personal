# Clearing Your Tracks On Linux

## Practice Demo

In this case the target is running a vulnerable version of Samba.

We get a command shell session, as the admin on the target system.

## ALWAYS USE THE /TMP DIRECTORY TO SAVE FILES/EXPLOITS.

## BE AWARE THAT THE CONTENTS OF /TMP DIRECTORY ARE DELETES ON REBOOT.

### Deleting the bash history file

In this case, the bash history file is not active, but normally it will be.

Navigate to the <mark style="color:red;">/root</mark> directory.

Locate the <mark style="color:red;">.bash\_history</mark>.

Delete the commands that you typed in from the file, that way it is less suspicious.

#### Clear the bash history

* <mark style="color:yellow;">cat  /dev/null > .bash\_history</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">history -c</mark>
