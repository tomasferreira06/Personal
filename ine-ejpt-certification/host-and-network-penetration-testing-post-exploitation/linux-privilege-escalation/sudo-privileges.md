# SUDO Privileges

## Practice Demo

### Confirming what commands we can run as sudo in the target system

* <mark style="color:yellow;">sudo -l</mark>

In this case we can run the <mark style="color:red;">/usr/bin/man</mark> as <mark style="color:blue;">sudo.</mark>

#### How "<mark style="color:red;">man</mark>"  works

Opens the manual for the specified binary

In this case we can run for example "<mark style="color:red;">sudo man ls</mark>", without entering the sudo password.

#### Why is this an opportunity for priv escalation?

Within man, we can scroll throughout the page to see the different intructions.

But if we enter:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">!/bin/bash</mark>

We gain a shell as the root user, because the "<mark style="color:red;">man</mark>" command was executed with root privileges.
