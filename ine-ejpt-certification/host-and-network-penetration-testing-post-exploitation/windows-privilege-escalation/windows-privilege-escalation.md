# Windows Privilege Escalation

## Practice Demo

We are continuing from where we left off in the last video, having run the "<mark style="color:red;">PrivescCheck</mark>" script.

It identified a privesc vuln in the service "Winlogon". The credentials for this are typically stored in the Windows Registry.

The script was able to get the clear-text passwords from the windows registry.

We will utilize a python implementation of the psexec utility, to login into the target system, with a privileged account.

* <mark style="color:yellow;">psexec.py 'User'@targetIP</mark>&#x20;

### Using msfconsole

&#x20;We use the module:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">exploit/windows/smb/psexec</mark>
