# Enumerating Processes & Services

After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what process, services and schedules tasks are currently running.

#### What are we looking for?

* Running processes & services
* Schedules tasks

A process is an instance of a running executable (.exe) or program.

A service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop.

## Practice Demo

Enumerate the target, exploit the rejetto vulnerability.

## Enumerate Process & Services

<mark style="color:purple;">NOTE:</mark> When listing processes, you are only able to see processes run by your account if you are not a privileged user

## In meterpreter:

#### Enumerate list of running processes

* <mark style="color:yellow;">ps</mark>

#### Search for Process ID of specified service

* <mark style="color:yellow;">pgrep 'nameofservice'</mark>

### Windows commands

#### Enumerate list of started services/Processes

* <mark style="color:yellow;">net start</mark>

We can also use

* <mark style="color:yellow;">wmic service list brief</mark>

#### List out processes  and the respective services being used by the processes&#x20;

* <mark style="color:yellow;">tasklist /SVC</mark>

#### List out of schedules tasks

* <mark style="color:yellow;">schtasks /query /fo LIST /v</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">NOTE:</mark> This outputs a lot of information, copy and paste it into a text file, because it can be useful for <mark style="color:red;">privesc.</mark>
