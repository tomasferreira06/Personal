# Setting Up A Web Server With Python

## Transferring Files to target systems

After obtaining initial access  to a target system, you will need to transfer files to the target system.

In some cases, you will not have access to the target system via a Meterpreter session, and as a result, you will need to use the inbuilt OS specific utilities to facilitate the transfer of files from your system to the target system.

This process utilies a two-step approach, where you will need to host the files you want to transfer on a web server and download  the files hosted on the web server to the target system.

## Setting up a Web server with Python

Python comes with a built-in module known as <mark style="color:red;">SimpleHTTPServer (python2)</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">http.server(python3)</mark>, that can be used to facilitate a simple HTTP server that gives you standard <mark style="color:blue;">GET</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">HEAD</mark> request handlers.

This module can be used to host files in any directory of your system. And can be implemented through a single command in your terminal.

## Practice Demo

#### Setting up the server  (python2)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80</mark>

#### Setting up the sever (python3)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">python3 -m http.server 80</mark>
