# Types of Testing

### Black Box Testing

* High-level testing process with no prior information about the application/service internals.
* Tester operates as a regular user, evaluating functionality and interaction.
* Involves interacting with the interface, such as buttons, to verify intended results.
* Requires no knowledge of programming or understanding of the program.
* Black-Box testing extends information gathering and enumeration time to comprehend the target's attack surface.

### Grey Box Testing

* Popular for penetration testing, Grey-Box testing combines black-box and white-box approaches.
* Tester possesses limited knowledge of internal components.
* Interaction with the application is akin to a black-box scenario.
* Tester uses their partial knowledge to identify and resolve issues.
* Grey-Box testing is efficient for well-hardened attack surfaces, saving time.

### White Box Testing

* Low-level testing typically performed by a knowledgeable software developer.
* Focus on testing internal components, ensuring specific functions operate correctly and efficiently.
* Tester possesses full knowledge of the application and its expected behavior.
* Time-consuming compared to black-box testing.
* White-Box testing guarantees comprehensive validation of the entire attack surface.
