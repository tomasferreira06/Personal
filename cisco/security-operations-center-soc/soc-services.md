# SOC Services

## Types of Services

SOC services include reactive and praoctive services in addition to other services.

### Reactive Services

#### **Monitor security posture:**

* This is the primary role of the SOC, and it includes monitoring the network and computers for security alerts and notifications and responding to them as the need dictates.

#### **Vulnerability management:**

* This refers to finding vulnerabilities in the company systems and patching them.

#### **Malware analysis:**

* The SOC might recover malicious programs that reached the network. They can do basic analysis, however more advanced analysis requires sending it to a dedicated team.

#### **Intrusion detection:**

* An IDS is used to detect and log intrusions and suspicious packets. SOC's job is to maintain such a system, monitor its alerts and go through its logs.

#### **Reporting:**

* It is essential to report incidents and alarms. Reporting is necessary to ensure a smooth workflow and to support compliance requirements.

### Reactive Services

#### Network security monitoring (NSM)

* This focuses on monitoring the network data and analyzing the traffic to detect signs of intrusion.

#### Threat Hunting

* SOC assumes an intrusion has already taken place and begins to hunt to see if they can confirm their assumption.

#### Threat Intelligence:

* Focuses on learning about potential adversaries and their tactics and techniques to improve the company's defences.
