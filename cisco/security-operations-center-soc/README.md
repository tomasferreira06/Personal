# Security Operations Center (SOC)

A SOC team of IT security professionals is tasked with monitoring a company's network 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## Purpose for Monitoring

#### **Find vulnerabilities on the network**

* A vulnerability is a weakness that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level.For instance, the SOC might discover a set of Windows computers that must be patched against a specifil published vulnerability.

#### **Detect unauthorized activity**

* Consider the case where an attacker discovered the username and password of one of the employees and used it to log in to the company system. Many clues can help us detect this, such as geographic location.

#### **Discover policy violations**

* A security policy is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threads and ensure compliance.

#### **Detect intrusions**

* Intrusions refer to system and network intrusions.One example scenario would be an attacker successfully exploiting our web application.

#### **Support with the incident response**

* An incident can be an observation, a policy violation, an intrusion attempt, or something more damaging such as a major breach.
