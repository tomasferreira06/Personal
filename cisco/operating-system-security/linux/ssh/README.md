# SSH

Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form.&#x20;

Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network - where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine.

* SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely.
* Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network such as the Internet

<mark style="color:red;">The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:</mark>

* The IP address of the remote machine
* Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine

For example: <mark style="color:blue;">`ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP`</mark>
