# Weak File Permissions

This is based on the principle of least privilege.

To be secure you should only give access to the data that is strictly necessary for the user to work with, nothing more.

Weak file permission make it easy for the adversary to attack confidentiality and integrity.

Confidentiality by accessing files they shouldn't have access to.

Integrity by being able to modify them.
