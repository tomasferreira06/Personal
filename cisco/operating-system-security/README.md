# Operating System Security

OS is the layer sitting between hardware and the applications/programs we are running.

Programs like Firefox,Whatsapp etc..

All of these run on top of an operating system which allows these programs to access the hardware according to certain rules.



<mark style="color:red;">When talking about security we should think of protecting the 3 following things:</mark>

* Confidentiality: Ensure that secret and private files and information are only available to intended persons.
* Integrity: It is crucial that no one can tamper with the files stored on your system or while being transferred on the network.
* Availability: You want your laptop or smartphone to be available to use anytime you decide.
