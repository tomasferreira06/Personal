# Databases

Often websites will need a way of storing information for their users. Webservers can communicate with databases to store and recall data from them.

&#x20;Databases can range from just a simple plain text file up to complex clusters of multiple servers providing speed and resilience.&#x20;

**You'll come across some common databases:**&#x20;

* MySQL;
* MSSQL;
* MongoDB;
* GraphQL;
* Postgres;
* and more.
