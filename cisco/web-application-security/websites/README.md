# Websites

When you visit a website, your browser (_like Safari or Google Chrome_) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting.&#x20;

It will respond with data that your browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.

#### Websites are primarily created using:

* HTML, to build websites and define their structure;
* CSS, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options;
* JavaScript, implement complex features on pages using interactivity.

#### There are two major components that make up a website:

* Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
* Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.
