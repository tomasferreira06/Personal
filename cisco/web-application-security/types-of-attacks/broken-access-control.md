# Broken Access Control

Access control ensures that each user can only access the files related to their work/account.

#### Vulnerabilities

* Failing to apply the principle of least privilege and giving users more access than the minimum required for them to execute their taks.
* Being able to view or modify somebody else's account by using its unique identifier (id=x).
* Being able to browse pages that require authentication as an unauthicated user.
