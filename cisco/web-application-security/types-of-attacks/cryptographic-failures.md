# Cryptographic Failures

Cryptography is the process of encryption and decryption of data.

In order to decrypt data you have to have the key that was used to encrypt it.

#### Examples of cryptographic failures include:

* Sending sensitive data in clear text,using HTTP instead of HTTPS for example
* Using a weak encryption algorithm.
* Using weak keys for cryptographic functions.
