# Identification and Authentication Failure

Identification is the ability to identify a user uniquely.

Authentication refers to the ability to prove that the user is whom they claim to be.

#### Weaknesses in this processes:

* Allos the attacker to use brute force attacks; try many password, normally using automated tools to find the valid credentials to login.
* Allowing the user (not attacker) to choose a weak password.
* Storing the user's password in plain text, instead of encrypting them.
