# Firewall

<mark style="color:red;">**Definition:**</mark>

* A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors, filters, and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

<mark style="color:red;">**Purpose:**</mark>

* Acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

<mark style="color:red;">**Traffic Inspection:**</mark>

* Examines data packets to determine if they should be allowed or blocked based on defined rules.

<mark style="color:red;">**Security Rules:**</mark>

* Rules specify what types of traffic are permitted or denied.
* Can be based on IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, or application types.

<mark style="color:red;">**Packet Filtering:**</mark>

* Filters incoming and outgoing packets to enforce the security rules.

<mark style="color:red;">**Network Address Translation (NAT):**</mark>

* Often includes NAT functionality to hide internal IP addresses from external networks.

<mark style="color:red;">**Proxying:**</mark>

* Acts as an intermediary for certain types of traffic, making requests on behalf of clients to enhance security.

<mark style="color:red;">**Logging and Auditing:**</mark>

* Maintains logs of network activity for monitoring and auditing purposes.

<mark style="color:red;">**Types:**</mark>

* Hardware Firewalls: Dedicated devices placed at network entry points.
* Software Firewalls: Installed on individual devices.

<mark style="color:red;">**Application Layer Filtering:**</mark>

* Inspects traffic at the application layer, making decisions based on the specific application.

<mark style="color:red;">**Intrusion Detection and Prevention:**</mark>

* Some firewalls include intrusion detection and prevention features to identify and block malicious activity.

<mark style="color:red;">**Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support:**</mark>

* Supports VPNs for secure remote access or connecting geographically distributed networks.

<mark style="color:red;">**Updates and Patching:**</mark>

* Regularly updated to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

<mark style="color:red;">**Default Deny Policy:**</mark>

* A common security principle where traffic is denied by default unless explicitly allowed.

<mark style="color:red;">**User Authentication:**</mark>

* Some firewalls incorporate user authentication to control access based on user credentials.

<mark style="color:red;">**In Summary:**</mark>

* A firewall is a security barrier that monitors and controls network traffic.
* It enforces security rules to allow or block traffic based on specific criteria.
* Firewalls can be hardware or software-based and play a crucial role in network security.
