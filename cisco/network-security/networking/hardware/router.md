# Router

* <mark style="color:green;">**Function:**</mark>
  * &#x20;A networking device operating at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Connectivity:**</mark>&#x20;
  * Connects different networks, directing data between them.

<mark style="color:red;">How it works:</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">**IP Address Handling:**</mark>
  * Uses IP addresses to identify devices and make routing decisions.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Routing Table:**</mark>
  * Maintains a routing table with information about network paths and the best routes for forwarding data.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Packet Forwarding:**</mark>
  * Examines the destination IP address of incoming packets.
  * Determines the optimal path based on the routing table.
  * Forwards packets to the next hop or final destination.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Inter-Network Communication:**</mark>
  * Facilitates communication between devices on different networks.
  * Manages traffic between the local network and external networks.
* <mark style="color:green;">**NAT (Network Address Translation):**</mark>
  * Translates private IP addresses within a local network to a single public IP address for external communication.
  * Enhances security and conserves public IP addresses.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Firewall Functionality:**</mark>
  * Often includes firewall capabilities to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
* <mark style="color:green;">**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**</mark>
  * Assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices on the local network.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Quality of Service (QoS):**</mark>
  * Manages and prioritizes network traffic to ensure efficient use of bandwidth.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Security Features:**</mark>
  * Implements security protocols such as VPNs to secure data transmission over the network.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Dynamic Routing Protocols:**</mark>
  * Utilizes dynamic routing protocols to adapt to changes in network topology.

In summary, a router directs data between different networks, manages IP addresses, facilitates inter-network communication, and incorporates security and QoS features for efficient and secure data transmission.
