# Spoofing

Spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address.

When this occurs, it can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy.

A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator.&#x20;

If a device were to pretend or "spoof" this MAC address, the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when it isn't.

Public places like hotels, cafes etc.. often use MAC address control when using their <mark style="color:yellow;">"Guest"</mark> or <mark style="color:yellow;">"Public"</mark> Wi-fi.
