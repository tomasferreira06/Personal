# Ports

<mark style="color:red;">**Definition:**</mark>

* Ports are virtual endpoints for communication in computer networks.
* They allow multiple services or applications to operate on a single device.

<mark style="color:red;">**Purpose:**</mark>

* Enables the identification of specific processes or services on a device.

<mark style="color:red;">**Port Numbers:**</mark>

* Assigned numerical values (port numbers) ranging from 0 to 65535.
* Well-known ports (0-1023) are reserved for commonly used services (e.g., HTTP on port 80, FTP on port 21).

<mark style="color:red;">**Transport Layer:**</mark>

* Ports operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.

<mark style="color:red;">**TCP and UDP:**</mark>

* Used by both Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* TCP and UDP use port numbers to distinguish different services.

<mark style="color:red;">**Dynamic vs. Well-Known Ports:**</mark>

* Well-known ports are reserved and standardized (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 21 for FTP).
* Dynamic or ephemeral ports (49152-65535) are used for temporary connections.

<mark style="color:red;">**Application Layer:**</mark>

* Associated with specific applications at the application layer (Layer 7).

<mark style="color:red;">**Multiplexing:**</mark>

* Allows multiple services on a single device to operate concurrently.

<mark style="color:red;">**Commonly Used Ports:**</mark>

* 80: HTTP, 443: HTTPS, 21: FTP, 25: SMTP, 22: SSH.

<mark style="color:red;">**Examples:**</mark>

* When accessing a website, a web browser may use port 80 for HTTP communication.

<mark style="color:red;">**Firewall Configuration:**</mark>

* Firewalls use port information to control the flow of network traffic.

<mark style="color:red;">**Security Considerations:**</mark>

* Ports play a role in network security by allowing or restricting access to specific services.

<mark style="color:red;">**In Summary:**</mark>

* Ports are virtual endpoints for communication in networks.
* They are identified by numerical port numbers.
* Used for distinguishing between different processes or services on a device.
* Operate at the transport layer and facilitate multiplexing of services on a single device
