# Star Topology

In this topology devices are individually connected via a central networking device such a <mark style="color:yellow;">switch</mark> or <mark style="color:yellow;">hub</mark>.

Any information sent to a device in this system is sent via the central device.

<mark style="color:red;">Advantages:</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">User friendly:</mark>
  * Without affecting the rest of the network, the new nodes can be added easily to the star topology. In that manner, we can easily remove the components in it.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Centralized network:**</mark>
  * The network is monitored with the help of a centralized management system using the hub, central computer, or switch.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Very reliable:**</mark>
  * When a device or a cable fails, then the other devices which are connected to it will Work.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Highly efficient:**</mark>
  * **Since each device has its own individual cable connecting to the central device, the chances of collisino of data are relatively low. This means the system's performance is higher than expected.**
* <mark style="color:green;">**Easily manageable:**</mark>
  * Within the star topology, fault detection is easily manageable. It is because the link is often easily identified.

<mark style="color:red;">Disadvantages:</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">High cost:</mark>
  * Within the star topology implementation of a router or switch, it's very costly, especially when using a router or a switch as the central network device.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Central device Dependency:**</mark>
  * Within the star topology, when a hub malfunctions, then everything goes down because no devices can work without a hub.
* <mark style="color:green;">**High maintenance:**</mark>
  * Within the star topology, regular maintenance and more resources are required by the hub because it is the central system of the star.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Low data transfer rates in the wireless system:**</mark>
  * a wired star topology system works better instead of a wireless one. A wireless LAN (WLAN) mobs much slower, so the risk of a bottleneck rises.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Prone to damage:**</mark>
  * Within the star topology, more potential damage exposure is created by the cables are wires used in it.
