# Ring Topology

The ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward the data.

In ring topology, devices are connected in a closed-loop or ring.

Each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a continuous circle.

<mark style="color:red;">**Advantages:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">**Simplicity:**</mark>&#x20;
  * Easy to install and configure.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Equal Data Transfer:**</mark>&#x20;
  * All devices have equal access to the network's resources.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Reliability:**</mark>&#x20;
  * If one connection fails, data can still travel in the opposite direction, minimizing downtime.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Predictable Performance:**</mark>&#x20;
  * Network performance is predictable as each device gets a turn to transmit data.

<mark style="color:red;">**Disadvantages:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">**Single Point of Failure:**</mark>
  * If the central link or a device fails, the entire network can be disrupted.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Limited Scalability:**</mark>&#x20;
  * Adding more devices can degrade performance as each device must pass the signal along.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Cost:**</mark>&#x20;
  * Implementation can be costlier compared to bus or star topologies.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Complex Troubleshooting:**</mark>&#x20;
  * Identifying faults or network issues can be challenging due to the circular nature of connections.
