# Bus Topology

This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable.

This type of topology is similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.



<mark style="color:red;">Advantages:</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">Cheaper than other alternatives:</mark>
  * It is cheaper as it does not require any additional device to set up. Moreover, the cable length required to establish bus topology is also comparatively less.
* <mark style="color:green;">No additional power source required:</mark>
  * The bus topology does not require any additional central equipment other than the node; therefore, there is no requirement for an additional power source to run the network.
* <mark style="color:green;">Easily Scalable:</mark>
  * It is easier to add new nodes in the network, such as Computers, Printers, and Scanners. If the nodes are physically located in the same location, each node has a working NIC (Network Interface Card).

<mark style="color:red;">Disadvantages:</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">Limited Connection Cable:</mark>
  * The length of the bus topology is physically limited. There is a limit to the physical cable that can be used to connect the nodes in the bus topology.
* <mark style="color:green;">Data transmission is not secure:</mark>
  * The data is transmitted to all the nodes along with the sender and receiving nodes. All the nodes in the network have access to all the data that is transmitted in the network.
* <mark style="color:green;">Vulnerable to physical damage:</mark>
  * The entire network may fail if the bus cable malfunctions. In order to transmit the data again in the network, the user first will have to rectify the error in the cable.
