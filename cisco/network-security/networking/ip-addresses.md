# IP Addresses

An IP address can be used as a way identifying a host on a network for a period of time.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Let's split up precisely what an IP address is in the diagram below:</mark>

An IP is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets.&#x20;

This number is calculated through a technique called IP addressing and subnetting.

IP addresses follow a set of standard protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force devices to communicate in the same language.

<mark style="color:red;">Depending on the type of network the devices are in (public /private), they will be associated with either:</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">Public IP address:</mark>
  * Used to identify the device on the Internet.
* <mark style="color:green;">Private IP address:</mark>
  * Used to identify a device amongst other devices.

These two devices will be able to use their private IPs to communicate with each other.&#x20;

However, data sent to the Internet from either device will  be identified by the same public IP (because the both belong to the same network).

Public IPs are provided by your <mark style="color:yellow;">ISP(Internet Service Provider)</mark>



There are two versions of the Inter Protocol addresing scheme:

* IPv4:
  * Uses a numbering system of 2^32 IPs (4.29 billion)
* IPv6:
  * Supports up to 2^128 IPs(340 trillion-plus)
  * More efficient
