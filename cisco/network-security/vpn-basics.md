# VPN Basics

<mark style="color:red;">**Definition:**</mark>

* A VPN is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, allowing users to access private networks as if they were directly connected.

<mark style="color:red;">**Secure Connection:**</mark>

* Encrypts data transmitted over the internet, enhancing privacy and security.

<mark style="color:red;">**Tunneling:**</mark>

* Establishes a "tunnel" through which data travels securely between the user's device and the private network.

<mark style="color:red;">**Remote Access:**</mark>

* Enables users to access a private network remotely as if they were physically present.

<mark style="color:red;">**Anonymity:**</mark>

* Masks the user's IP address, providing a degree of anonymity.

<mark style="color:red;">**Types:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">**Site-to-Site VPN:**</mark>
  * Connects entire networks securely over the internet.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Remote Access VPN:**</mark>
  * Allows individual users to connect to a private network from remote locations.

<mark style="color:red;">**Protocols:**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Uses Encryption:**</mark>

* Utilizes encryption protocols to protect data during transmission.

<mark style="color:red;">**Public Networks:**</mark>

* Often used over public networks like the internet to create a secure connection.

<mark style="color:red;">**Business Applications:**</mark>

* Used by businesses to connect remote offices, provide secure access for employees, and facilitate collaboration.

<mark style="color:red;">**Personal Use:**</mark>

* Individuals use VPNs for privacy, bypassing geo-restrictions, and securing public Wi-Fi connections.

<mark style="color:red;">**Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS):**</mark>

* Some enterprises use MPLS to create private VPNs over a service provider's network.

<mark style="color:red;">**Client-Server Architecture:**</mark>

* Typically involves a client (user's device) connecting to a server (VPN server) to establish a secure connection.

<mark style="color:red;">**Two-Factor Authentication:**</mark>

* Enhances security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification before accessing the VPN.

<mark style="color:red;">**End-to-End Encryption:**</mark>

* Ensures that data remains confidential and secure from the user's device to the VPN server.

<mark style="color:red;">**In Summary:**</mark>

* VPNs provide secure and encrypted connections over public networks.
* They are used for remote access, privacy, and connecting geographically distributed networks.
* Different types and protocols cater to various needs, enhancing security and anonymity.
