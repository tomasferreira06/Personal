## What is Subnetting?

* Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks called subnets.
* It allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and facilitates network management and routing.
* Subnetting is commonly used in IPv4 networks.
* CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method used to represent IP addresses and their corresponding subnet masks.
* It specifies the network prefix length, which indicates the number of bits used for the network portion of the IP address.
* CIDR notation is expressed by appending a forward slash (/) followed by the prefix length to the IP address.
