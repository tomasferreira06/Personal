# Scanning and Enumeration

## Enumeration

#### For this section, we are using Kioptrix, a vulnerable machine from [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) for beginners.

* To log in to Kioptrix machine:

```
#on Kali Linux

ifconfig
#to get IP address 10.0.2.7

netdiscover -r 10.0.2.0/24
#using ARP to detect all machines on network
#gives us the IP address of Kioptrix, 10.0.2.4

nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.0.2.4
#-T4 is for speed, -p- for scanning all ports, -A for scanning everything
#analyze scan results and lookup exploits
```

### Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS:

We can visit the links [http://10.0.2.4](http://10.0.2.4/) and [https://10.0.2.4](https://10.0.2.4/) for port 80 and 443. It shows that the default webpage uses Apache and PHP.

Information disclosure - Apache documentation link given in [http://10.0.2.4](http://10.0.2.4/) leads to 404 page with Apache version 1.3.20.

### Using a web vulnerability scanner:

```
apt install nikto #web vuln scanner tool

nikto -h http://10.0.2.4 #scans website, shows vuln

dirbuster #tool for directory scanning
```

Burp Suite can be used to see and modify response in real-time using the Repeater window.

Information disclosure - Server headers reveal version information.

### Enumerating SMB

* SMB (Samba) is used for fileshare services, here it used on port 139.

#### For enumeration:

```
msfconsole #loads the Metasploit framework

search smb #search for exploits related to smb
#choose one of the exploits

use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version #use particular module

info #get information

options #get only options

set RHOSTS 10.0.2.4 #from options, set RHOSTS (Remote Host) as 10.0.2.4

run #run exploit
#This gives us the version of SMB - Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)

#In a new terminal tab, we can use another tool called smbclient to connect to fileshare service
smbclient -L \\10.0.2.4\\ #-L to list all, the slashes are for escaping characters

#this gives us more information about the sharename and servers
#we can attempt to connect
smbclient \\\\10.0.2.4\\ADMIN$
#cannot connect as we do not have password

smbclient \\\\10.0.2.4\\IPC$ #this works and we get access to smb

help

ls #not allowed

exit
```

### Enumerating SSH

From the nmap scan, we know that the SSH version on port 22 is OpenSSH 2.9p2. We can attempt to connect using `ssh 10.0.2.4` but it would not work unless we know the password.

After enumeration, we can research the vulnerabilities using Google and find if there are any exploits related to it. Examples of resources include [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) and [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/). For offline searches, use `searchsploit` in the terminal.

## Scanning

### Vulnerability scanning with Nessus:

#### To setup Nessus:

```
#After downloading Nessus package
cd Downloads/

dpkg -i Nessus-10.1.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb

/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service #start Nessus scanner
#now go to <https://kali:8834/> to configure the scanner
```

Once Nessus is configured, we can launch a basic network scan or an advanced network scan of the Kioptrix machine.

After the scan is completed, we can check all the vulnerabilities and based on that we can find exploits.
