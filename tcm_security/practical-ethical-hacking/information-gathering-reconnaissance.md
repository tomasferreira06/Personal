# Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)

## Passive Reconnaissance

We can use [BugCrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/) as a platform for practicing recon.

Tools for discovering email addresses:

* [Hunter](https://hunter.io/)
* [Phonebook.cz](https://phonebook.cz/)
* [VoilaNorbert](https://www.voilanorbert.com/)
* [Clearbit Connect](https://connect.clearbit.com/)
* [Email Hippo](https://tools.emailhippo.com/)

[DeHashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) can be used to find breached credentials.

### Hunting subdomains:

```
apt install sublist3r #tool for finding subdomains

sublist3r -d tesla.com
```

[crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) can be used for certificate fingerprinting.

Tools such as [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) and [Wappalyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/) can be used for identifying technologies used in a website. `whatweb` can be used as an alternative, and can be used from the Kali Linux terminal itself.

`Burp Suite` can be used for information gathering by intercepting requests.

[Google Advanced Search](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) can be used for efficient Googling.
